lived seven princesses. Each had their chosen place in court, but the youngest princess
had a special skill. She could pluck clouds from the sky
and spin them into the softest robes. Her work was so precise, not even the most expert eye
could find a seam. 00:30But her craft was the same day after day,
and she longed for new inspiration. Finally, the Queen Mother granted 
the weaver permission to visit Earth. The other princesses would accompany her to protect their sister 
from earthly dangers. Dressed in special robes that allowed them
to fly between Heaven and Earth, the sisters soared down from the sky. The weaver was in awe 
of the rolling hills and rivers, and the sisters decided to swim
in one of the glittering streams. As the weaver floated,
she dreamt about staying forever. 01:09Meanwhile, a lone cowherd
approached the riverbank. He came here often
to sweep his parent’s grave and speak with his only companion— a stoic bull who listened patiently 
to the cowherd’s sorrows. But upon seeing the weaver’s beauty,
the cowherd forgot his routine. While he longed to introduce himself,
his lonely lifestyle had made him timid. Thankfully, the bull saw his friend's
plight and offered some advice. He told the cowherd of the swimmer’s 
celestial origins and of her dream to stay on Earth; but also that she could only remain 
if she lost her ticket back to Heaven. 01:55As the cowherd approached,
the princesses flew away in fear— leaving their dreaming sister behind. While keeping her magic robes hidden, the cowherd offered his own garment 
as a substitute. And after gaining her trust, 
the pair began exploring the countryside. She was struck by his caring nature, and he learned to see 
the world’s wonder through her eyes. Before long, the two had
fallen deeply in love. 02:26The weaver and the cowherd
built a prosperous life. Their farm flourished, and the weaver 
taught her skills to local villagers. As time marched on, the pair was 
blessed with two healthy children, but their bull was growing old. Before he died, the bull implored
the family to keep his hide and use its magic at their time of need. While the husband grieved for his friend, the weaver’s mind turned
to her other family. Dusting off her magical robe,
she decided to pay a visit to the heavens. But when the weaver
swept into her old home, no one seemed surprised to see her. With a start, she realized
that barely any time had passed— for a year on Earth
was merely a day in Heaven. 03:18When her family learned of her new life,
they were enraged. How dare she waste her love on a human? The weaver tried to escape back to Earth, but the Queen Mother plucked 
a golden hairpin from her head and tore through the sky. A great gulf opened, forming a river
of stars between Heaven and Earth. Below, the cowherd trembled, but he also
remembered the bull’s final words. Hastily placing each child in a basket, he draped the bull’s pelt
over his back and hurtled upwards. 03:53Above the clouds, each lover attempted
to wade through the surging stars. But no matter how hard they struggled, the gulf between them
only grew wider. Day after day, the Queen Mother
watched without pity. Years passed, and the weaver 
and the cowherd had no one, except the passing magpies 
to cheer them on. Finally, their love moved
the Queen Mother’s heart. While she couldn’t forgive
her granddaughter entirely, the Queen Mother would allow the weaver
to meet her earthly family once a year. 04:27And so, in late summer, the magpies
form a bridge across the Milky Way, reuniting the weaver and the cowherd. At this time of year, millions of people
in East and Southeast Asian countries tell similar tales of these 
star-crossed lovers, celebrating their annual reunion. "
1,How friendship affects your brain,Shannon Odell,Sep 2022,"If it seems like friendships formed in adolescence are particularly special, that's because they are.

place in our life stories. What is it about these connections
that make them so unique? Before we dive into the science, 
let’s first observe one in action. 00:20If I could somehow design
a best friend, you know, put together all the ideal qualities
of my perfect match, that person would pale 
in comparison to Priya. 00:29She can turn any situation 
into a good time— chemistry lab, band practice. What I’m trying to say is I never laugh
harder than when I’m with Priya. 00:39And she’s always there for me. Like last year after I got dumped by Te—
you know what? I don’t even want to mention their name. It felt like my whole world
was crashing down. But as soon as I told Priya, boom,
she was at my door. I was a wreck, 
but she sat there with me and listened. 00:56We’re always on the same page; it’s as if we can read each other’s minds! And we can talk for hours— about anything. I know my mom would say she has
the phone bills to prove it. 01:08If it seems like friendships formed
in adolescence are particularly special, that’s because they are. Early childhood, adolescent, 
and adult friendships all manifest a little differently in part because the brain works 
in different ways at those stages of life. Adolescence is a unique time when
peer relationships take focus, and thanks to the developing brain, there are changes in the way you value, 
understand, and connect to friends. 01:34Teenage friends can seem
attached at the hip. Scientists describe adolescence
as a social reorientation as teenagers begin to spend 
as much or more time with their friends 
than with their parents. This drive to hang with pals may be due 
to changes in the brain’s reward center, known as the ventral striatum. Its activation makes hanging
out with others enjoyable and motivates you to spend
more time with them. Neuroimaging studies show that this region
is highly reactive during your teenage years, which may explain why adolescents 
seem to place a higher value on social interactions 
than children or adults. 02:11Teenage friendships can also
feel more intimate than the friendships of your childhood. This deeper connection is possible thanks
to improvements in what scientists call Theory of Mind. Theory of Mind is the ability 
to understand others’ emotions, thoughts, motivations, and points of view, and to realize that they may
be different from your own. While it may seem intuitive, this ability hinges on the careful
coordination of various brain regions, sometimes referred to as the social brain. Babies begin to develop Theory of Mind
around 18 months or so. Before that, it’s thought they believe
that everyone perceives and knows exactly what they know. It was once considered to be 
fully developed by age five, but scientists now know 
that Theory of Mind continues to improve and mature
well into your teenage years and beyond. Likewise, regions within the social brain
show increased connectivity during adolescence compared 
with childhood. As a result, teens can better understand
their friend’s perspectives, allowing for deeper connections 
to flourish. 03:15In the closest friendships, it can almost feel as if you’re
metaphysically connected— two bodies and minds, perfectly in sync. And there is science to this! Your ability to connect with others
somewhat depends on the coordination of actions, emotions,
physiology, and thoughts. This is what psychologists call
interpersonal synchrony. You first show signs of the ability
to sync with others as infants— synchronizing movements 
and babbling with your parents. As you get older and spend more time 
outside the home, you increasingly show this synchrony
with your peers. For example, imagine walking
down the street with a friend. Often without consciously thinking, you stroll at the same pace
and follow the same path. You and your best friend may 
not be only on the same page, but also scientifically, in step. "

1,The relationship between sex and imagination,Gina Gutierrez,Jun 2022,"Sex is as much mental as it is physical -- and imagination is the most powerful tool we have to expand our personal agency and capacity for pleasure, says sexual wellness storyteller Gina Gutierrez. The founder of audio-erotica company Dipsea, Gutierrez creates immersive audio stories designed to open up space to explore your desires and fantasies on your terms. She shares some tips to inspire your sexual imagination and bring joy, confidence and empowerment into your life.", (50K),"Transcript (12 Languages)Bahasa IndonesiaEnglishEspañolFrançaisItalianoPortuguês brasileiroPortuguês de PortugalTiếng Việtעבריתالعربيةภาษาไทย中文 (简体)00:01""Oh, I'm not in the mood"". Who here has ever
told a partner that before? 00:08(Laughter and murmuring) 00:12We've all done this. And if you haven't said it,
then you've probably heard it. Intuitively, we understand that our minds matter
when it comes to sex, but we’re quick to focus
on bodies, touch and sensation as the most crucial elements. We're less likely to consider
the role of our imaginations. 00:32In many parts of our life,
we are really great at imagining. Things like vacations
or dream homes or career moves. These exercises in imagination
help us define what it is we want. They allow us to flirt
with what's possible before having to make any decisions. And they're also innately pleasurable, even if those fantasies
never actually materialize. Imagination is such a powerful tool. So when it comes to sex, why isn't it
one of the first ones that we reach for? When I first started doing research
on arousal and desire, I learned that for women,
cognition is as important to arousal as the presence of sexual stimuli. In other words, using their memories,
fantasies and some focus, women can turn themselves on
with their thoughts. This particular study focused on women, and much of my own work is also focused
on people who are female identifying. But this much is clear
regardless of gender identity: the brain is the biggest sex organ, and everyone can benefit
from expanding their sexual imagination. 01:42I first started thinking about this connection
between sex and imagination while I was in college. Back then, among my friends, the definition of sex
was extremely narrow. It essentially meant penetrative sex
between a guy and a girl. And masturbation
wasn't a topic of conversation. Frankly, I think that solo sex
was seen as a last resort, a desperate or lonely act instead of a fundamentally
empowering exploration. 02:12One morning, a friend of mine
was telling me about her latest unsatisfying hookup, and I asked her what
she had been thinking about during sex. ""Hmm,"" she said. “I don’t know.” 02:27Something about that really struck me. Her entire memory of the experience
was what had happened physically. So many of us think that good sex
is something that should happen to us, that it’s in someone else’s hands,
quite literally, We expect a partner, current or future,
to be the magical unlock. Maybe because we feel
especially safe with them or attracted to them or because they have
more experience than we do. But in doing so, we forget
our own agency in the matter. We write ourselves and our imaginations
out of the pleasure equation. 03:04I had this hunch that my friend, that many of us, were experiencing
a crisis of inspiration. In the years after college, my fascination with the role
of imagination and sexuality only grew. Eventually, I left the career I'd built
to start a company called Dipsea, which creates stories, audio stories,
designed to turn women on. I decided to focus on audio because it's so immersive
and so evocative and so personal. 03:36Here's what I mean. Feel free to close your eyes
and consider where these sounds take you. 03:42(Birds chirping) 03:44(Water flowing) 03:57OK. Open your eyes. Were those not the sounds
you were imagining I'd play? 04:02(Laughter) 04:03Here's what comes to my mind. I'm in the mountains. I can feel the sunshine on my face. I can feel the cool chill
coming up off the Alpine water. I can see the tiny flecks
of sparkle in the granite. I bet that every person in this room
is imagining something a little different, but filled with all sorts of distinct
details about the surroundings, about the circumstances. Audio is incredible that way. Erotic audio stories
have characters and plot, but like the sounds you just heard
create a blueprint for your mind to then fill in the blanks. They allow you to develop
your own vision of what's appealing in a way that can get lost when you see something specific
or explicit onscreen. 04:51You may not be ready or interested in dipping a toe
into erotic audio stories. And that's OK. So today I'm going to walk you through how you might get started
creating your own stories and activating
your own sexual imagination. I won't take this too far.
You don't have to follow along right now. But consider this a guide for the next time
you get a little me time. 05:13(Laughter) 05:15First, you'll want to settle
into your mind the same way that you
might start a meditation. Then imagine that your mind
is like a projector. Everything you can see and experience
is what's right in front of you. Everything to your left,
right, behind you, that's out of frame. This is important because
while there are thoughts that turn us on, there are also thoughts that are
incredibly effective at turning us off: stress, shame, insecurities, and also the things
that inexplicably ick us out. So when a thought appears
that isn't working, and it inevitably will, you'll be able to sweep it out of frame. 05:57You can start with your senses. Imagine colors, textures, sounds, images, anything that gives you sensory pleasure. Sometimes I like to imagine
cherry blossoms softly floating down from trees. Or I use a fiery pinkish orange
or a relaxing blue as a backdrop for the experience that I'm imagining. 06:19Next, try places. And keep in mind that setting
will be more important to some of us than to others. Reach back into your memory to that secluded beach
you visited many years ago. Or create a setting from scratch
with as much privacy and comfort, or as many adventurous stakes as you like. Next think about a person
and layer on a narrative. Maybe it's a character
from one of your favorite books. Maybe it's your girlfriend. Hey, maybe it's a guy in a kilt. Whoever it is, how do they approach you? What's motivating them? What energy are they coming to you with? What about you? What do you say? And what do you do together? And when you find something
that you really like, play it out for a while. You’ll have just designed your own story. 07:09The more you flex this muscle, the more you'll understand
what turns you on and be able to communicate
those things to a partner. You can share the entire fantasy
with them if you're comfortable. That kind of disclosure
can be very intimate and affirming. Or ... don't. It is not a betrayal
to use your imagination to bring you more pleasure. Fantasy is a safe space, and it's time we bust the myth
that what you fantasize about and what you want to happen in reality are always the same thing. 07:44So allow me to offer us
a bigger definition of what sex is. Sex isn't just a physical act. It's a mental experience. And it isn't wholly
dependent on a partner. It starts with you. You're the one in control
of creating the most pleasure for you. You're the protagonist. As much as you love someone
or feel attracted to them, they are playing a supporting role. And you for them. Sex is an avenue to accessing feelings
of aliveness, empowerment, joy and confidence innate to all of us. That aliveness,
that is the impact of sexual wellness. And you will feel it
walking down the street, entering any conversation,
navigating any relationship. Put that way, none of us can afford
not to prioritize sex. It isn't a nice-to-have
or an if-I-get-to-it, dead last on our list
right after picking up the dry cleaning. 08:45So the next time you notice that you haven't been
in the mood for a while, carve some time out for yourself and let your imagination
tell you a sexy story. 08:56Thank you. 08:58(Applause) "
1,Why bittersweet emotions underscore life's beauty,Susan Cain,May 2022,"Life is a constant state of both joy and sorrow, dark and light, bitter and sweet. In a meditative conversation, author Susan Cain explores how being attuned to the bittersweetness of life -- and being fully present for both the happy times and the sad times -- helps us navigate love and loss and connect to the ""insane beauty"" of the world. (This conversation, hosted by TED current affairs curator Whitney Pennington Rodgers, was part of an exclusive TED Membership event. Visit ted...", (47K),"Transcript (7 Languages)EnglishEspañolFrançaisPortuguês de Portugalالعربية中文 (简体)한국어00:00Susan Cain: The idea of bittersweetness
is that we live in a constant state, all humans do, it's a constant state
of a kind of existence simultaneously of joy and sorrow, dark and light, bitter and sweet. And then what comes with that is a heightened awareness
of impermanence in all things, and also a kind of curiously piercing joy
at the beauty of the world. Because there's something
about having this deep awareness that the joy comes with sorrow,
the sorrow comes with joy, that makes us really attuned
to the insane beauty all around us. 00:42You know, I think the Stoics
come at that from one point of view. You know, there's the stoic idea
of, they would call it memento mori, to remember all the time
that we could die tomorrow, we don't know what's going to happen. And that's a way of both calming us down and also making life feel
a little more precious. So you know, the Stoics come at it
from that point of view. I don't know that I think of myself
as a Stoic explicitly, but I do feel there's something
about being aware of life's fragility that situates us exactly
where we should be. 01:18Whitney Pennington Rodgers:
Why do you think art is a way that we see
bittersweetness being expressed really masterfully? 01:29SC: I believe that all humans ... That the most fundamental
aspect of our humanity is that we all have a kind of
longing for a state that I call the perfect
and beautiful world. You know, like in ""The Wizard of Oz,""
it's called ""somewhere over the rainbow,"" all religions have their own name for it, my favorite is the Sufi name
of the beloved of the soul. And what creativity really is
at the end of the day is an expression of that longing
for a more perfect and beautiful world. You know, what an artist
or a musician is doing, is they're having a vision of ... You know, the gap between
the world that we're in and the world that they longed to be in
and therefore to create. And so whether you're talking
about a violin piece or a rocket to Mars, there's really no difference
between those two things. 02:21Like, the word longing itself, the etymology of it literally means
to reach for, you know, to grow longer and to reach for. And that's what we're doing
when we're creative. And I do want to hasten to say that ... You don't need to compose a symphony that people are going to be listening to
hundreds of years later. You don't have to build the rocket to Mars in order to express
that fundamental human creativity. You could be sitting at home
and drawing a picture or baking a pie. It doesn't really matter. Like, all these different actions are expressions of our longing
and of our better nature. 03:01I believe that the art and the music and the nature and religion
and spirituality are all just different
manifestations of the same thing. And what that thing is, we probably
all have to define for ourselves, but it is the most fundamental
drive in all of human nature. And I believe our best one, you know,
it's the one that leads to creativity, but also to connection and to love. Like, I literally -- sorry to go on
with this question, but I literally have sitting taped up
in front of me in my office right now ... A quotation from the poet
Jalāl al-Dīn Rūmī, who was a Sufi poet, and I'm going to quote it for you, but I'm just going to set
the context of the poem. It's basically ... It’s about a man who is praying to Allah, and a cynical person
comes along and asks him, ""Why are you praying? You never got an answer back, did you? So why are you praying?"" 04:03And the man thinks about it and is troubled
by the cynic's observation. And he falls into a fitful sleep during
which he's visited by Khidr, the guide of souls, who says to him, ""Why did you stop praying?"" 04:18And he said, ""Well, you know,
God never answered me, Allah never answered."" 04:22And this is what Khidr
says to him, he says, and now I'm quoting from the poem itself, ""This longing you express
is the return message. The grief you cry out from
draws you toward union. Your pure sadness that wants help
is the secret cup."" 04:40And I have this taped up in my office because I believe that ... I believe that that's the truth, whether we consider ourselves atheists
or believers or somewhere in between. To me, is a false dichotomy. 04:54WPR: It's beautiful. Can you share a little bit more
about the process that went into writing this book and how you ultimately found yourself in this place where bittersweet
was the end product? 05:09SC: As most of us do,
I come from a heritage of love and loss. In my case, most members of my family,
the previous generations, were killed in the Holocaust. On my mother's side and my father's side. You know, I explore in the book
the whole phenomenon of inherited grief, how it transmits to us,
both culturally and epigenetically. And so I think that that's a kind of
unconscious backdrop that had been with me from the beginning. Of just having a sense
of kind of, like a tragic view of life, but also a view that I kind of, just can't believe
how beautiful it is sometimes. So I'm sort of holding
those two things at the same time. And yeah, so I just had
all these questions about how to make sense
of this paradox of life. 06:07And so I just went off
on this five-year journey. I mean, I went and talked to Pete Docter,
who is the director at Pixar, who created the movie ""Inside Out,"" which is a movie that's really
all about sadness and the positive value
that sadness has in our lives. And as I say, I explored
all these wisdom traditions. I went and talked to neuroscientists. I spent a lot of time with a psychologist
named Dacher Keltner, who's done all this fascinating, groundbreaking work on what he calls
your inner compassionate instinct and how we're basically
evolutionarily designed to react to the sadness of other beings. And this comes from the fact that we're creatures
who have to take care of our young like, we don't survive
if we don't do that. And so that means that we're primed
to respond to the cries of babies. Except it radiates out from there. We don't only respond
to our own baby's tears, we end up responding to other babies, and we also end up responding
to other beings in general. And we definitely do not get this right, because we also, as Darwin had noticed, Darwin said, we have this deep,
compassionate instinct, but we also have obviously this propensity
to these astonishing acts of cruelty. So both of these things are part of us. And ... And the question becomes, how do we most draw
on the compassionate side of our deeper instincts? 07:45WPR: There's a question here from Miriam where they ask just about how
we can be present for each other as we're feeling different emotions. The question specifically is, ""Can we be fully present for one another
if one is experiencing sadness and the other is happiness?"" 08:01SC: Yeah, I think the answer is to be
fully present for each other. And I'll tell you one little hack
that I've developed for that. I don’t know if hack is the right word. But there’s this amazing video
that went viral a few years ago. It was put out by the Cleveland
Clinic Hospital. And this was a video
that they put together to teach empathy to their caregivers. And the way they did this, is they had a camera kind of, moving through the corridors
of the hospital, lingering for a moment on the face
of this passer-by or that passer-by. Just the way you do in normal life, right? You're like, walking through
and you just see people as you go and you’re not really thinking
that much about it. Except that in the case of this video, they had little captions
underneath each random person that you were passing by. And sometimes the captions
were joyful ones, like, ""just learned that he's going to be
a father for the first time."" But because we're in a hospital,
more often the captions are not so joyful. And it's things like, you know, caption under a little girl saying
goodbye to her father for the last time. It's things like that. And you cannot watch this video
without tearing up. It's impossible. Which is why it went viral. You also become aware,
as you're watching it, you're not only tearing up, you literally are having the sensation
of expanding chest muscles. Like, you can feel it
physically and literally. And ... And we actually know
from the work of Dacher Keltner, who I was just talking about, that we have our vagus nerve, which is the biggest bundle
of nerves in our body, and it governs our most
fundamental instincts, like breathing and digestion. You know it's really basic. But your vagus nerve
also responds and fires up when it sees somebody else in distress. So you know, this is a very deep
and fundamental impulse. And what I take from the lesson
of that Cleveland Clinic video is just the simple exercise of imagining
what people's captions are as you walk through the world. You know, you don't necessarily know them. But now I'll go into a grocery store and as the person's
ringing up my groceries, I'm thinking, what's her caption? What is it? And it's a completely different way
of interacting with people once you do that. 10:28WPR: And connected to this, Gordon asks how your experience
with the pandemic and lockdown informed the writing of the book. Did it change the book from what you initially
envisioned it to be? 10:41SC: My father and my brother
actually passed away from COVID quite early during the pandemic. There's something about grappling
with these subjects for years, as I had been doing, that actually helped me pass
through those particular moments and weather those particular moments. I guess I'll just give you
one specific example. So one of the wisdom traditions
that I found most illuminating, and I wrote about this in the book, it's the one that Leonard Cohen's
song comes from, you know, the idea of light coming
from the crack in everything. So he got that from the Kabbalah, which is the mystical side
of the Jewish tradition. And one of the fundamental
stories in the Kabbalah is the idea that all of creation originally
was one divine vessel of light that ultimately shattered and that now we're living in the world
after the shattering. But these divine shards of light
are still scattered all around us, and they're buried
in the mud all around us. And so our job is
to walk through the world and pick up the shards where we can
and maybe shine them up a little bit. And the beauty is that I'm going
to see one set of shards, but you're going to notice
completely different ones. So we all go around and pick up our own. 12:04When my father passed away from COVID, I started reflecting on his life and ... My father was a person who ... He was a doctor
and a med school professor, and he worked really,
really hard and did great work. And at the same time that he did all that, he also would perform these, you could call them
senseless acts of beauty, maybe. He loved orchids, so he built a greenhouse
full of orchids in our basement. For really no reason
other than that he loved orchids. And so he grew them and gazed at them. And he loved the French language, so he learned how to speak French, even though he had no time
to visit France and rarely did. But he would sit there and learn it
and loved the act of learning it. And there were so many different
things like this that he did. And when he died, I started thinking
about all those acts of beauty that he had performed in his work and in these seemingly
senseless acts of beauty. And I framed them all as shards
that he had been picking up all his life. And ... That was, yeah, that was a really helpful way of thinking of him
and remembering him and bringing me to some form
of peace with his loss. 13:28WPR: As we slowly come out
of the pandemic, how can we better normalize
talking about loss and talking about these feelings that you've mentioned
our culture sort of shies away from? 13:39SC: Well, I think it's really helpful
to start in our organizations. I mean, we can obviously start privately, which in some ways is the easiest because we don't have to corral
anybody else to do it. But in our organizations, there are small steps that we can take. So I'm thinking, for example, I do a lot of public speaking, lately Zoom talks, where I come in
and talk about introversion and I guess now bittersweetness. Anyway, I did one not that long ago,
it was a Zoom call. And we were talking
about the power of introverts. And the call started with a chat,
just the way this one did. And the organizer asked them questions
like, ""How's everybody feeling today?"" And everybody typed in, you know,
""I'm feeling great."" ""I'm feeling excited,""
""I'm feeling joyful,"" feeling all these things. And I love it. If they were in fact
feeling that way, that's awesome. And I also ask, what is the chance
that everybody truly was feeling that way? This long list of people
coming into the chat, what's the chance that was accurate? Maybe zero percent? I would love to see us develop ways, and maybe the way to start
is with anonymous chats or an option to be anonymous in chats, but for organizers and for team leaders
and so on to be asking, ""What are you all truly feeling?"" ""What are you going through right now?"" And again, maybe anonymous and maybe not. When we're gathering in person, we could have whiteboards up. In schools they sometimes do this
and they call it a parking lot, where people could just write down
what they're going through that day, the joys and the sorrows, so that people start becoming aware
of kind of like, the normality of what actual experience is. 15:26We as a society need to figure out
how we can start telling the truth of what it's like to be alive. That's what I would say. I mean, that's actually
the reason I write books, that's how I always think of it. It's like there's really no point
other than telling a truth that isn't otherwise
being spoken out loud. 15:49And there's also an incredible
safety in numbers, you know. Once lots of people start
talking about the same thing, it suddenly becomes OK
to tell that particular truth of what it's like to be alive. So we have to just find ways of telling it and then more and more
people will share it. 16:06[Get access to thought-provoking events

1,The benefits of not being a jerk to yourself,Dan Harris,Oct 2022,"After more than two decades as an anchor for ABC News, an on-air panic attack sent Dan Harris's life in a new direction: he became a dedicated meditator and, to some, even a guru.

for something called a 360 review. 00:05(Laughter) 00:08If you've ever worked
in the corporate world, you probably have heard
of this diabolical exercise. 00:13(Laughter) 00:15It’s an anonymous survey with
your bosses, peers and direct reports, and the idea is to get a panoramic sense
of your strengths and weaknesses. I opted for the colonoscopy
version of a 360 review. 00:26(Laughter) 00:28Which included my wife, my brother
and two of my meditation teachers. In all, 16 people gave
hour-long confidential interviews, and I was then handed a 39-page report
brimming with blind quotes. I can tell you're looking forward
to hearing the results. Sadists. 00:46(Laughter) 00:49But I'm going to make you wait a second, because I should give you
a little background on me. I used to be an anchorman. I worked at ABC News for 21 years. It was a very stressful job. In fact, I had a panic attack
live on the air in 2004 while delivering some
otherwise mundane headlines. The good news is that
my nationally televised freakout ultimately led me to meditation, which I had actually
long rejected as ridiculous. I was raised by a pair
of atheist scientists. I'm a fidgety, skeptical guy. And that kind of led me
to unfairly lump meditation in with aura readings,
vision boards and dolphin healing. But the practice really helped me
with my anxiety and depression. And so my goal became
to make meditation attractive to my fellow skeptics by ditching the New Age cliches
and liberally using the f-word. 01:44(Laughter) 01:47To my great surprise,
this unorthodox approach turned me into a quasi self-help guru. And a few years into this trip,
I decided that I wanted to get a sense of whether my inner work
was having outer results, you know? Was meditation making me a nicer person? And that's why I signed up for the 360. And now I will tell you about the results. 02:07The first 13 pages were dedicated
to my sterling qualities. People talked about
how hardworking and intelligent I was. Many also said meditation
had made me more caring. But then came 26 pages of beatdown. 02:21(Laughter) 02:23The first blow was
that some reviewers noted that I had a penchant
for being rude to junior staffers, which was deeply embarrassing. But it only got worse. I was called emotionally guarded,
a diva and an authoritarian. 02:39(Quiet laughter) 02:40I don't know why that's funny. 02:41(Laughter) 02:46Some people even questioned my motives
for promoting meditation. It got so bad that at one point my wife,
who was reading it with me, got up and went to the bathroom and cried. I think for me the most painful part was realizing that the aspects
of my personality that I was most ashamed of
and had really tried to hide were in fact on full display
for everybody. And those included my two most prominent
and problematic demons: anger and self-centeredness. 03:14(Clears throat) 03:15Sorry. I've never talked
about this publicly before. 03:20(Applause) 03:21Thank you. 03:26I thought we weren't supposed
to applaud authoritarians here at TED. 03:30(Laughter) 03:33Bottom line, meditation
had helped, for sure, but I clearly retained
the capacity to be a schmuck, and I am not alone in this. All kinds of bad behavior
have been on the rise. Reckless driving, unruly airline passengers, violent crime, online bullying, workplace incivility, tribal antagonism,
even general self-centeredness. At times, it can really feel
like our social fabric is unraveling. 04:01So after my 360, I decided
to do some work on myself and to see if I could also
learn some things that, by extension,
might help the species. I pulled every lever at my disposal. I did psychotherapy,
communications coaching, bias training, couples counseling and more. And while I was really grateful
to be able to do all of this stuff and all of it helped, I was still finding myself too often
getting selfish or snippy. So I signed up
for a nine-day silent retreat where I would practice
a kind of meditation that has been shown
to boost your capacity for warmth. It’s called “loving-kindness,”
which, as you might imagine, sounded to me like Valentine's Day
with a gun to my head. 04:40(Laughter) 04:45But I was in it to win it.
I really wanted to be a nicer person. I kept getting tripped up though, because the woman
who was running the retreat, my teacher, her name is Spring Washam, she kept insisting that if I wanted
to be less of a jerk to other people, I needed to start
by being less of a jerk to myself, which I thought
was the kind of thing you hear from Instagram influencers
and spin instructors, so -- 05:05(Laughter) 05:07And she even went so far as to suggest that when I saw my demons
emerging in meditation, I should put my hand on my heart
and say to myself, ""It's OK, sweetie. I'm here for you."" 05:17(Laughter) 05:19Hard pass. 05:20(Laughter) 05:21Pasadena. I was not going to do that. 05:24But over the ensuing days
of nonstop meditation, I did notice that my twin demons
were in full effect. My anger had me rehearsing
glorious, expletive-filled speeches I would deliver to my boss
about the various promotions I deserved. My self-centeredness had me writing
my own five-star Amazon reviews for my various books, praising my elegant prose
and rugged good looks. 05:46(Laughter) 05:47And in the face of all of this
roostering and rage, I layered on an avalanche
of self-criticism. I told myself a whole story about how I was an incurably
self-obsessed, cranky monster who had cloven hooves
and a retractable jaw. 06:06After about five or six days
of drinking from this fire hose, I caved. Mid-meditation, I put my hand on my heart, and while I definitely was not going
to call myself ""sweetie,"" I did silently say to myself, ""It's all good, dude,
I know this sucks, but I've got you."" This was very strange and embarrassing,
but in this moment, I had an epiphany. I realized that my demons were actually just ancient, fear-based
neurotic programs, probably injected into me
by the culture, by my parents. And they were trying to help me. It was the organism
trying to protect itself. And when I stopped fighting them,
they calmed down for a few seconds. I didn't have to slay them. I just had to give them a high five. And this counterintuitive
extension of warmth was not, I realized, it was not indulgent. It was radical disarmament. 07:03Here's the way I think about this. At any given moment,
we humans have two choices or two spirals that are available to us. The first is what my friend
Evelyn Tribole calls the toilet vortex. The reason why this looks childish
and ridiculous is that I drew it myself. 07:19(Laughter) 07:21It's OK, sweetie.
You're good at so many other things. 07:23(Laughter) 07:25(Applause) 07:29I probably shouldn't make fun of the thing
I'm going to try to get you to do, but ... The toilet vortex might start like this. You're picking on yourself because you
don't like the way you look in the mirror. You're unhappy with
your level of productivity or you have failed
to achieve ketosis, whatever. And then you take that out on other people and then you are feeling more miserable, and then down you go. 07:51The vastly superior alternative
is what I call the cheesy upward spiral. This one was drawn by a professional. 07:59(Laughter) 08:01As your inner weather gets balmier, because you've learned
how to high-five your demons, that shows up in your relationships
with other people. And because relationships
are probably the most important variable when it comes to human flourishing, your inner weather improves even further and up you go. And that is the whole point here. Self-love, properly understood,
not as narcissism, but as having your own back, is not selfish. It makes you better
at loving other people. And the flip side of this
was on full display in my 360. All the ways in which
I was torturing myself showed up in my relationships
with other people. And as those relationships
suffered, so did I. 08:40Taken together, my two excellent drawings represent a kind of amateur
unified field theory of love. I call it “Me, A Love Story.” 08:51(Laughter) 08:53That's a deliberately ridiculous name, but I am actually pretty serious
about using the word ""love."" Granted, it's a confusing term
because we use it to apply to everything from our spouses to our children
to gluten-free snickerdoodles. But I am comfortable
embracing the broadness of the term. I consider love to be anything that falls
within the human capacity to care, a capacity wired deeply
into us via evolution. It's our ability to care,
cooperate and communicate that has allowed Homo sapiens to thrive. And it is a failure
to exercise that muscle, it is a lack of love that I think is
at the root of our most pressing problems, from inequality to violence
to the climate crisis. Obviously, these are all massive problems that are going to require
massive structural change, but at a baseline they also require us
to care about one another. And it is harder to do that when you're stuck in a ceaseless spiral
of self-centered self-flagellation. 09:50(Applause) 09:51Thank you. 09:54So I guess what I'm trying to say here is there's a geopolitical case
for you to get your shit together. 09:59(Laughter) 10:00And the massively empowering news is that love is not
an unalterable factory setting. It is a skill that you can train. It's actually a family of skills. After my 360, I learned a whole bunch
of practices for upping my love game, and I'm going to share
two with you right now that I think would be very easy
to integrate into your life. The first is to boot up a practice
of loving-kindness meditation. I should say that it does not require you to subscribe to some fancy
metaphysical program, and it shouldn't take up too much time. Maybe a few minutes
a couple of times a week to start. The instructions are really simple.
Find a reasonably quiet place. Assume a comfortable position, close your eyes and begin
by envisioning a really easy person. Maybe a good friend, maybe a pet. And then you repeat
in your mind four phrases: ""May you be happy, may you be safe,
may you be healthy, may you live with ease."" After you've generated a little warmth, you do a bait-and-switch
and move onto yourself. Once again, you conjure
the image and send the phrases. After that, it's on to a mentor,
somebody who's helped you in your life. Then a neutral person,
somebody you might overlook. Then a difficult person,
probably not hard to find. And then we finish
with all beings everywhere. To some of you,
this may seem forced and treacly, but it's worth noting
that the research shows that this practice has
physiological, psychological and even behavioral benefits. 11:29The other practice I'm going to recommend is to start consciously counterprogramming
against your inner critic. Next time you notice yourself
going down the toilet, if nobody's looking,
put your hand on your heart and talk to yourself
the way you would talk to a good friend. For ambitious people,
this may be a little scary. You might fear
it's going to erode your edge. But research shows that this process
of replacing your sadistic inner tyrant with a supportive inner coach,
who has high standards but is not a jerk about it, makes you more likely to reach your goals. 12:01Now, I will cop to the fact that even though I've now retired
from my job as a news man and am a full-time meditation evangelist, I still go down the toilet on the regular. But I'm much more likely
to access the upward spiral these days. In fact, three years after my 360,
I got another one, because I never learn. And this one was way different. People gushed about how much I had changed
as a friend and a mentor and a colleague. They talked about specific meetings where I used to be a prosecutor
and was now delightful. One person said, “His ego is shrinking,”
which I think was a compliment. And another person said,
“He’s finding his heart,” which the new me let pass. 12:39(Laughter) 12:43After she finished reading,
my wife turned to me and said, ""Congratulations, now you're boring."" 12:48(Laughter) 12:51I'm hoping that was a joke
because in my opinion, upping your love game
is anything but boring. It’s countercultural because
it cuts against the never-enoughness and always-behindness
that society seems to want us to feel. It’s courageous because
it’s hard to look at your demons. And it’s happiness-producing
because when you high-five your demons, they don't own you as much. And all of that makes you
more generous and more available. If that sounds grandiose
or touchy-feely to you, let me put it to you another way. The view is so much better
when you pull your head out of your ass. 13:24(Laughter) 13:27Thank you very much. 13:28(Applause) "

put your hand on your heart and talk to yourself
the way you would talk to a good friend. For ambitious people,
this may be a little scary. You might fear
it's going to erode your edge. But research shows that this process
of replacing your sadistic inner tyrant with a supportive inner coach,
who has high standards but is not a jerk about it, makes you more likely to reach your goals. 12:01Now, I will cop to the fact that even though I've now retired
from my job as a news man and am a full-time meditation evangelist, I still go down the toilet on the regular. But I'm much more likely
to access the upward spiral these days. In fact, three years after my 360,
I got another one, because I never learn. And this one was way different. People gushed about how much I had changed
as a friend and a mentor and a colleague. They talked about specific meetings where I used to be a prosecutor
and was now delightful. One person said, “His ego is shrinking,”
which I think was a compliment. And another person said,
“He’s finding his heart,” which the new me let pass. 12:39(Laughter) 12:43After she finished reading,
my wife turned to me and said, ""Congratulations, now you're boring."" 12:48(Laughter) 12:51I'm hoping that was a joke
because in my opinion, upping your love game
is anything but boring. It’s countercultural because
it cuts against the never-enoughness and always-behindness
that society seems to want us to feel. It’s courageous because
it’s hard to look at your demons. And it’s happiness-producing
because when you high-five your demons, they don't own you as much. And all of that makes you
more generous and more available. If that sounds grandiose
or touchy-feely to you, let me put it to you another way. The view is so much better
when you pull your head out of your ass. 13:24(Laughter) 13:27Thank you very much. 13:28(Applause) "

watching my father raise the pistol to my mother's head. She pleaded with him to put the gun down, but he ignored her. When she bolted toward the door,
he followed close behind and once outside,
he fired one single shot. I was 12. I remember this moment frame by frame. I remember feeling numb. I remember feeling alone. 00:34Thank God, the bullet missed her, but my family would never be the same. I would never be the same. I didn't know then all the ways that my parents' on-again,
off-again relationship would impact me, but I knew I didn't want
a love like theirs. My story would be different. 00:57Years later, when I met you, I fell madly in love. Our connection was undeniable. It was as if you had been
hand-picked just for me. I thought we'd be together forever. But we struggled with some
of the same issues my parents had, and after nearly nine years together, we called it quits. 01:19We had Sekou then. He was only three. Though he was too young
to really understand what was going on, he was old enough to know that mommy and daddy were not going to be living
in the same house anymore. 01:33Our breakup hit me really hard. But I decided I wouldn't let my broken heart
get in the way of what was best for Sekou. We struggled initially,
trying to navigate this new space as co-parents. I asked myself, how do we raise this beautiful boy
full of wonder and promise and so much power, in spite of our failures as a couple? The answer for me was simple. I could either choose fear, fear of being alone, fear of the unknown, or choose love. And I chose love. That means seeing
the good in you as a father. It means seeing
the good in you as a father and not your missteps as a partner. It means putting Sekou first every time, even if it means I don't get my way. 02:33I know my parents went back and forth trying to work things out
for my brother and I's sake. Though I appreciate their effort, I wish they hadn't. I saw too much, I heard too much. I knew I didn't want
that to be Sekou's story. I wanted Sekou to know what it was like to see
two parents who got along, two parents who worked together as a team. I wanted him to know what love looks like in its truest form. Love is patient, love is kind. Love does not anger easily, it keeps no wrongs. Love always protects, always trusts, always hopes,
always perseveres. 03:25Shaka Senghor: It was 1983. I was 11 years old. I remember being in a basement
with my father, in our home on the east side of Detroit. I watched him stuff albums into the blue and orange milk crates, as tears streamed from his eyes. Just before that, him and my mother had just sat me and my siblings down and told us that they
were calling it quits. Thirty years later, I found myself with tears in my eyes, as I packed my belongings in our home. 04:11Ebony and I met while I was serving
a 19-year prison sentence. For four years, we used letters, phone calls and visits to build what we had imagined
to be an unshakeable bond. We fought the system together, and we thought that we would be able
to right the wrongs of our parents. She was a poet, I was a writer. She was gorgeous, with a PhD. I was handsome, with a GED. 04:49(Laughter) 04:53We built something magical. We built something
that we thought would endure. But unfortunately, our relationship became unhinged
when I was released from prison. Post-traumatic stress syndrome, trauma from prior to going to prison, baggage from her relationship, my inexperience in a relationship undid the magic of what we built
behind the walls. Centered in all of that was our beautiful boy. 05:32I remember when we first
brought Sekou home. It was so exciting, it was amazing, we worked together, we collaborated, we supported each other. You took the night shift,
I took the morning shift. And it was going amazing. And then it all changed. It changed the morning that you came in
really excited, you was like, ""Hey, I'm going back to work! Aren't you excited?"" And I was like, ""Yes.
I am ecstatic right now. 06:02(Laughter) 06:03I cannot be more delighted."" But inside, I was really afraid. But I couldn't tell you that. So instead, I said, ""Hey, go off and have a wonderful day."" 06:20And you left, and I was left with Sekou. What I understand now about that moment is that we were fostering a trust that's necessary for parents to coexist. And that you were trusting me
with our most precious gift. And that you were building the foundation
and the blocks for what's important for this portal we call parenthood. 06:48ER: Knowing how our parents'
breakups impacted us, you know, we were really sensitive about how our breakup would impact Sekou. We struggled, but we found our way. And let Sekou tell it, we're the best parents in the world. I love that he sees us that way. We made a choice in the beginning to co-parent as allies 
and not adversaries. To break the toxic pattern that we see play out over and over again when parents lose focus
on what's most important, the children. They allow their relationship pain
to get in the way. But at the end of the day,
we're on the same team, and that's Sekou's team. 07:35You know, I have to admit, we have an unconventional relationship a lot of people don't understand. We're not perfect as parents or people. But we honor each other's role
in Sekou's life. We allow him to do things that our parents
would never allow us to do. We don't allow our fears
to put limits on him. We nurture his natural curiosity
about the universe and his relationship to the world. 08:05Remember that time when we were
coming in from a long day at work, and Sekou found a puddle outside, a puddle of mud, mind you. Had a brand new fresh outfit on,
Levi's from head to toe. And he found this puddle of mud,
and he reached for it. And he wanted to touch the muddy earth,
and we allowed him to do that. We resisted the urge to say no, and in fact, went and got him a shovel, and allowed him
to feel the earth's properties and explore as much
as he wanted to, and he played, and was as happy as a pig in mud. 08:36(Laughter) 08:37We realized that the outfit
could be washed, that a bath would clean up all the dirt, but the thrill of being in the moment, of being able to touch and be amazed at this thing
that he had never discovered before was more valuable than the clothes
or the dirt that could be washed away. 08:56We continue to rethink
what is right and wrong when it comes to parenting. Sekou challenges us every day. You know, we allow him to climb on couches and draw on his clothes and his shoes, let him run around the store --
well, I do, anyway. And I get the death stares
from other mamas who look at me and who think that children should be
quiet and well-behaved in public. 09:25I also get those questions
that are really judgments, but I don't pay them any mind. Because at the end of the day, our job is to guide Sekou
on this journey of life, not to control him. We're here to help him
figure out his place in the world, to uncover his greatest gifts, to discover why he was born. We are raising a free black boy in a world that despises black joy, and we refuse to put limits on him
that the world already has. 10:00SS: Our parenting
can be seen as an allegory for this two-sided coin of possibilities. On one side, the reality of raising
a black boy in a society that says that black boys,
black bodies and black lives only seen as profitable or disposable. And then there's the other side. Possibility of two parents
who are no longer together coexisting, supporting each other, loving each other,
showing affection publicly in a way that honors
the relationship with our son. And even more importantly is the power to support each other
in all those vulnerable moments. 10:43There was this one time that it was my day to go pick up Sekou,
you remember that time? I go pick Sekou up, he's in first grade, and as I'm walking up, another parent walks up
and says, ""Hey, Shaka. I seen Oprah Winfrey
give a shout-out to you on CNN last night."" She was super excited, exuberant even. I was mortified. Because I thought, what's going to happen
when she tells another parent, and they tell another parent, and then they go and look me up and then they discover that I was in prison
for second-degree murder. And then their child hears about it. And they come to school,
and they say to Sekou, ""Your dad was convicted
of murdering someone."" And I remember,
as watching Sekou race out, and I knew that I had to call Ebony. When I called her,
I explained to her what happened, Ebony said, ""You have to have the talk."" 11:44So I took Sekou home, got him ready for bed, and we talked for half an hour. I talked to him
about why I went to prison. And I listened to his feedback. And then we called his mom
so we can do our nightly ritual of her offering prayer and then me doing affirmations. And I remember holding him tightly. And I realized the importance
of the affirmations that we do at night. And I see them as a road map, as a guide, as a touchstone
for other parents to protect and to empower their children, especially in a world
where it's very difficult. 12:26For us, co-parenting is so much more than scheduling pick-up and drop-off, playdates, deciding what he's going to wear,
what he's going to eat. For us, it's about helping
each other carry the weight, unpack the load, and to show up in the world
in a way that honors the beauty of our son. And it's for these reasons
that we do affirmations. 12:52ER: We never though we'd be here. But here we are. And we hope that the way
that we show up for Sekou and for each other is a model of what successful
co-parenting can look like. We'd like to bring you all in
to this nightly ritual of affirmations that Shaka does with Sekou
every night at bedtime. 13:14SS: Hey. 13:16(Applause) 13:23SS: I am great.
Sekou: I am great. 13:25SS: I am awesome.
Sekou: I am awesome. 13:27SS: I'm amazing.
Sekou: I'm amazing. 13:28SS: I am thoughtful.
Sekou: I am thoughtful. 13:31SS: I am kind.
Sekou: I am kind. 13:32SS: I am loving.
Sekou: I am loving. 13:34SS: I am caring.
Sekou: I am caring. 13:35SS: I am funny.
Sekou: I am funny. 13:37SS: I'm smart.
Sekou: I'm smart. 13:39SS: I'm a big boy.
Sekou: I'm a big boy. 13:41SS: I'm a soldier.
Sekou: I'm a soldier. 13:43SS: I'm a warrior.

2,The benefits of not being a jerk to yourself,Dan Harris,Oct 2022,"After more than two decades as an anchor for ABC News, an on-air panic attack sent Dan Harris's life in a new direction: he became a dedicated meditator and, to some, even a guru.

In a wise, funny talk, he shares his years-long quest to improve his relationships with everyone (starting with himself) and explains the science behind loving-kindness medita...", (43K),"Transcript (9 Languages)EnglishEspañolFrançaisItalianoRomânăSvenskaالعربيةفارسى中文 (简体)00:01A few years ago, I signed up
for something called a 360 review. 00:05(Laughter) 00:08If you've ever worked
in the corporate world, you probably have heard
of this diabolical exercise. 00:13(Laughter) 00:15It’s an anonymous survey with
your bosses, peers and direct reports, and the idea is to get a panoramic sense
of your strengths and weaknesses. I opted for the colonoscopy
version of a 360 review. 00:26(Laughter) 00:28Which included my wife, my brother
and two of my meditation teachers. In all, 16 people gave
hour-long confidential interviews, and I was then handed a 39-page report
brimming with blind quotes. I can tell you're looking forward
to hearing the results. Sadists. 00:46(Laughter) 00:49But I'm going to make you wait a second, because I should give you
a little background on me. I used to be an anchorman. I worked at ABC News for 21 years. It was a very stressful job. In fact, I had a panic attack
live on the air in 2004 while delivering some
otherwise mundane headlines. The good news is that
my nationally televised freakout ultimately led me to meditation, which I had actually
long rejected as ridiculous. I was raised by a pair
of atheist scientists. I'm a fidgety, skeptical guy. And that kind of led me
to unfairly lump meditation in with aura readings,
vision boards and dolphin healing. But the practice really helped me
with my anxiety and depression. And so my goal became
to make meditation attractive to my fellow skeptics by ditching the New Age cliches
and liberally using the f-word. 01:44(Laughter) 01:47To my great surprise,
this unorthodox approach turned me into a quasi self-help guru. And a few years into this trip,
I decided that I wanted to get a sense of whether my inner work
was having outer results, you know? Was meditation making me a nicer person? And that's why I signed up for the 360. And now I will tell you about the results. 02:07The first 13 pages were dedicated
to my sterling qualities. People talked about
how hardworking and intelligent I was. Many also said meditation
had made me more caring. But then came 26 pages of beatdown. 02:21(Laughter) 02:23The first blow was
that some reviewers noted that I had a penchant
for being rude to junior staffers, which was deeply embarrassing. But it only got worse. I was called emotionally guarded,
a diva and an authoritarian. 02:39(Quiet laughter) 02:40I don't know why that's funny. 02:41(Laughter) 02:46Some people even questioned my motives
for promoting meditation. It got so bad that at one point my wife,
who was reading it with me, got up and went to the bathroom and cried. I think for me the most painful part was realizing that the aspects
of my personality that I was most ashamed of
and had really tried to hide were in fact on full display
for everybody. And those included my two most prominent
and problematic demons: anger and self-centeredness. 03:14(Clears throat) 03:15Sorry. I've never talked
about this publicly before. 03:20(Applause) 03:21Thank you. 03:26I thought we weren't supposed
to applaud authoritarians here at TED. 03:30(Laughter) 03:33Bottom line, meditation
had helped, for sure, but I clearly retained
the capacity to be a schmuck, and I am not alone in this. All kinds of bad behavior
have been on the rise. Reckless driving, unruly airline passengers, violent crime, online bullying, workplace incivility, tribal antagonism,
even general self-centeredness. At times, it can really feel
like our social fabric is unraveling. 04:01So after my 360, I decided
to do some work on myself and to see if I could also
learn some things that, by extension,
might help the species. I pulled every lever at my disposal. I did psychotherapy,
communications coaching, bias training, couples counseling and more. And while I was really grateful
to be able to do all of this stuff and all of it helped, I was still finding myself too often
getting selfish or snippy. So I signed up
for a nine-day silent retreat where I would practice
a kind of meditation that has been shown
to boost your capacity for warmth. It’s called “loving-kindness,”
which, as you might imagine, sounded to me like Valentine's Day
with a gun to my head. 04:40(Laughter) 04:45But I was in it to win it.
I really wanted to be a nicer person. I kept getting tripped up though, because the woman
who was running the retreat, my teacher, her name is Spring Washam, she kept insisting that if I wanted
to be less of a jerk to other people, I needed to start
by being less of a jerk to myself, which I thought
was the kind of thing you hear from Instagram influencers
and spin instructors, so -- 05:05(Laughter) 05:07And she even went so far as to suggest that when I saw my demons
emerging in meditation, I should put my hand on my heart
and say to myself, ""It's OK, sweetie. I'm here for you."" 05:17(Laughter) 05:19Hard pass. 05:20(Laughter) 05:21Pasadena. I was not going to do that. 05:24But over the ensuing days
of nonstop meditation, I did notice that my twin demons
were in full effect. My anger had me rehearsing
glorious, expletive-filled speeches I would deliver to my boss
about the various promotions I deserved. My self-centeredness had me writing
my own five-star Amazon reviews for my various books, praising my elegant prose
and rugged good looks. 05:46(Laughter) 05:47And in the face of all of this
roostering and rage, I layered on an avalanche
of self-criticism. I told myself a whole story about how I was an incurably
self-obsessed, cranky monster who had cloven hooves
and a retractable jaw. 06:06After about five or six days
of drinking from this fire hose, I caved. Mid-meditation, I put my hand on my heart, and while I definitely was not going
to call myself ""sweetie,"" I did silently say to myself, ""It's all good, dude,
I know this sucks, but I've got you."" This was very strange and embarrassing,
but in this moment, I had an epiphany. I realized that my demons were actually just ancient, fear-based
neurotic programs, probably injected into me
by the culture, by my parents. And they were trying to help me. It was the organism
trying to protect itself. And when I stopped fighting them,
they calmed down for a few seconds. I didn't have to slay them. I just had to give them a high five. And this counterintuitive
extension of warmth was not, I realized, it was not indulgent. It was radical disarmament. 07:03Here's the way I think about this. At any given moment,
we humans have two choices or two spirals that are available to us. The first is what my friend
Evelyn Tribole calls the toilet vortex. The reason why this looks childish
and ridiculous is that I drew it myself. 07:19(Laughter) 07:21It's OK, sweetie.
You're good at so many other things. 07:23(Laughter) 07:25(Applause) 07:29I probably shouldn't make fun of the thing
I'm going to try to get you to do, but ... The toilet vortex might start like this. You're picking on yourself because you
don't like the way you look in the mirror. You're unhappy with
your level of productivity or you have failed
to achieve ketosis, whatever. And then you take that out on other people and then you are feeling more miserable, and then down you go. 07:51The vastly superior alternative
is what I call the cheesy upward spiral. This one was drawn by a professional. 07:59(Laughter) 08:01As your inner weather gets balmier, because you've learned
how to high-five your demons, that shows up in your relationships
with other people. And because relationships
are probably the most important variable when it comes to human flourishing, your inner weather improves even further and up you go. And that is the whole point here. Self-love, properly understood,
not as narcissism, but as having your own back, is not selfish. It makes you better
at loving other people. And the flip side of this
was on full display in my 360. All the ways in which
I was torturing myself showed up in my relationships
with other people. And as those relationships
suffered, so did I. 08:40Taken together, my two excellent drawings represent a kind of amateur
unified field theory of love. I call it “Me, A Love Story.” 08:51(Laughter) 08:53That's a deliberately ridiculous name, but I am actually pretty serious
about using the word ""love."" Granted, it's a confusing term
because we use it to apply to everything from our spouses to our children
to gluten-free snickerdoodles. But I am comfortable
embracing the broadness of the term. I consider love to be anything that falls
within the human capacity to care, a capacity wired deeply
into us via evolution. It's our ability to care,
cooperate and communicate that has allowed Homo sapiens to thrive. And it is a failure
to exercise that muscle, it is a lack of love that I think is
at the root of our most pressing problems, from inequality to violence
to the climate crisis. Obviously, these are all massive problems that are going to require
massive structural change, but at a baseline they also require us
to care about one another. And it is harder to do that when you're stuck in a ceaseless spiral
of self-centered self-flagellation. 09:50(Applause) 09:51Thank you. 09:54So I guess what I'm trying to say here is there's a geopolitical case
for you to get your shit together. 09:59(Laughter) 10:00And the massively empowering news is that love is not
an unalterable factory setting. It is a skill that you can train. It's actually a family of skills. After my 360, I learned a whole bunch
of practices for upping my love game, and I'm going to share
two with you right now that I think would be very easy
to integrate into your life. The first is to boot up a practice
of loving-kindness meditation. I should say that it does not require you to subscribe to some fancy
metaphysical program, and it shouldn't take up too much time. Maybe a few minutes
a couple of times a week to start. The instructions are really simple.
Find a reasonably quiet place. Assume a comfortable position, close your eyes and begin
by envisioning a really easy person. Maybe a good friend, maybe a pet. And then you repeat
in your mind four phrases: ""May you be happy, may you be safe,
may you be healthy, may you live with ease."" After you've generated a little warmth, you do a bait-and-switch
and move onto yourself. Once again, you conjure
the image and send the phrases. After that, it's on to a mentor,
somebody who's helped you in your life. Then a neutral person,
somebody you might overlook. Then a difficult person,
probably not hard to find. And then we finish
with all beings everywhere. To some of you,
this may seem forced and treacly, but it's worth noting
that the research shows that this practice has
physiological, psychological and even behavioral benefits. 11:29The other practice I'm going to recommend is to start consciously counterprogramming
against your inner critic. Next time you notice yourself
going down the toilet, if nobody's looking,
put your hand on your heart and talk to yourself
the way you would talk to a good friend. For ambitious people,
this may be a little scary. You might fear
it's going to erode your edge. But research shows that this process
of replacing your sadistic inner tyrant with a supportive inner coach,
who has high standards but is not a jerk about it, makes you more likely to reach your goals. 12:01Now, I will cop to the fact that even though I've now retired
from my job as a news man and am a full-time meditation evangelist, I still go down the toilet on the regular. But I'm much more likely
to access the upward spiral these days. In fact, three years after my 360,
I got another one, because I never learn. And this one was way different. People gushed about how much I had changed
as a friend and a mentor and a colleague. They talked about specific meetings where I used to be a prosecutor
and was now delightful. One person said, “His ego is shrinking,”
which I think was a compliment. And another person said,
“He’s finding his heart,” which the new me let pass. 12:39(Laughter) 12:43After she finished reading,
my wife turned to me and said, ""Congratulations, now you're boring."" 12:48(Laughter) 12:51I'm hoping that was a joke
because in my opinion, upping your love game
is anything but boring. It’s countercultural because
it cuts against the never-enoughness and always-behindness
that society seems to want us to feel. It’s courageous because
it’s hard to look at your demons. And it’s happiness-producing
because when you high-five your demons, they don't own you as much. And all of that makes you
more generous and more available. If that sounds grandiose
or touchy-feely to you, let me put it to you another way. The view is so much better
when you pull your head out of your ass. 13:24(Laughter) 13:27Thank you very much. 13:28(Applause) "
2,The benefits of not being a jerk to yourself,Dan Harris,Oct 2022,"After more than two decades as an anchor for ABC News, an on-air panic attack sent Dan Harris's life in a new direction: he became a dedicated meditator and, to some, even a guru. But then an anonymous survey of his family, friends and colleagues turned up some brutal feedback -- he was still kind of a jerk. In a wise, funny talk, he shares his years-long quest to improve his relationships with everyone (starting with himself) and explains the science behind loving-kindness medita...", (43K),"Transcript (9 Languages)EnglishEspañolFrançaisItalianoRomânăSvenskaالعربيةفارسى中文 (简体)00:01A few years ago, I signed up
for something called a 360 review. 00:05(Laughter) 00:08If you've ever worked
in the corporate world, you probably have heard
of this diabolical exercise. 00:13(Laughter) 00:15It’s an anonymous survey with
your bosses, peers and direct reports, and the idea is to get a panoramic sense
of your strengths and weaknesses. I opted for the colonoscopy
version of a 360 review. 00:26(Laughter) 00:28Which included my wife, my brother
and two of my meditation teachers. In all, 16 people gave
hour-long confidential interviews, and I was then handed a 39-page report
brimming with blind quotes. I can tell you're looking forward
to hearing the results. Sadists. 00:46(Laughter) 00:49But I'm going to make you wait a second, because I should give you
a little background on me. I used to be an anchorman. I worked at ABC News for 21 years. It was a very stressful job. In fact, I had a panic attack
live on the air in 2004 while delivering some
otherwise mundane headlines. The good news is that
my nationally televised freakout ultimately led me to meditation, which I had actually
long rejected as ridiculous. I was raised by a pair
of atheist scientists. I'm a fidgety, skeptical guy. And that kind of led me
to unfairly lump meditation in with aura readings,
vision boards and dolphin healing. But the practice really helped me
with my anxiety and depression. And so my goal became
to make meditation attractive to my fellow skeptics by ditching the New Age cliches
and liberally using the f-word. 01:44(Laughter) 01:47To my great surprise,
this unorthodox approach turned me into a quasi self-help guru. And a few years into this trip,
I decided that I wanted to get a sense of whether my inner work
was having outer results, you know? Was meditation making me a nicer person? And that's why I signed up for the 360. And now I will tell you about the results. 02:07The first 13 pages were dedicated
to my sterling qualities. People talked about
how hardworking and intelligent I was. Many also said meditation
had made me more caring. But then came 26 pages of beatdown. 02:21(Laughter) 02:23The first blow was
that some reviewers noted that I had a penchant
for being rude to junior staffers, which was deeply embarrassing. But it only got worse. I was called emotionally guarded,
a diva and an authoritarian. 02:39(Quiet laughter) 02:40I don't know why that's funny. 02:41(Laughter) 02:46Some people even questioned my motives
for promoting meditation. It got so bad that at one point my wife,
who was reading it with me, got up and went to the bathroom and cried. I think for me the most painful part was realizing that the aspects
of my personality that I was most ashamed of
and had really tried to hide were in fact on full display
for everybody. And those included my two most prominent
and problematic demons: anger and self-centeredness. 03:14(Clears throat) 03:15Sorry. I've never talked
about this publicly before. 03:20(Applause) 03:21Thank you. 03:26I thought we weren't supposed
to applaud authoritarians here at TED. 03:30(Laughter) 03:33Bottom line, meditation
had helped, for sure, but I clearly retained
the capacity to be a schmuck, and I am not alone in this. All kinds of bad behavior
have been on the rise. Reckless driving, unruly airline passengers, violent crime, online bullying, workplace incivility, tribal antagonism,
even general self-centeredness. At times, it can really feel
like our social fabric is unraveling. 04:01So after my 360, I decided
to do some work on myself and to see if I could also
learn some things that, by extension,
might help the species. I pulled every lever at my disposal. I did psychotherapy,
communications coaching, bias training, couples counseling and more. And while I was really grateful
to be able to do all of this stuff and all of it helped, I was still finding myself too often
getting selfish or snippy. So I signed up
for a nine-day silent retreat where I would practice
a kind of meditation that has been shown
to boost your capacity for warmth. It’s called “loving-kindness,”
which, as you might imagine, sounded to me like Valentine's Day
with a gun to my head. 04:40(Laughter) 04:45But I was in it to win it.
I really wanted to be a nicer person. I kept getting tripped up though, because the woman
who was running the retreat, my teacher, her name is Spring Washam, she kept insisting that if I wanted
to be less of a jerk to other people, I needed to start

2,What you can learn from people who disagree with you,Shreya Joshi,Oct 2022,"Youth leader Shreya Joshi diagnoses a key source of political polarization in the US and shows why having ""uncomfortable conversations"" with people you disagree with is crucial to bridging the divide. ""When we are able to recognize what unites us, it becomes so much easier to have conversations about what divides us,"" she says.", (27K),"Transcript (2 Languages)Englishالعربية00:00OK, guys, let's go back to high school. Does anyone remember that feeling of walking into the school cafeteria
with your tray in your hand and not knowing where to sit? Yeah, I see some people nodding, OK, cool. You might have sat alone, or perhaps more likely, you looked for someone who felt familiar. You sat with a group of people
that reminded you of you. And even today,
when deciding where to sit, how many of you
chose to sit next to someone who looked or felt different from you? I would bet that not many of you did that. I guess not much changes
in some situations, whether you're 17 or you're 70. 00:49We've all likely felt this tendency
to gravitate towards people who look, think and act like us. It's comfortable,
but it can also be harmful because this polarization
that we face today isn't just about believing
that the other side is factually wrong. We are beginning to see the other side
as malevolent beings with a hateful and hidden agenda. And you can see this. You can see this in the screaming
cable news pundits, the politicians who vote down bills just because they come
from the other side of the aisle. The hate groups
that violently attack people who are different from themselves. 01:30When I see these things as a teenager, I just feel so sad, so angry and so scared of this world that I'm soon going
to be entering as an adult. But there's something that I found
in having conversations with my peers that I think can be a path forward
from all of this. An approach that focuses on conversations with the intent to listen and learn. Not to win and not to agree. 01:59So I'm a 17-year-old
from Naperville, Illinois. In the summer before my sophomore
year of high school, I attended the ACLU National Advocacy
Institute's high school program in Washington, DC. During this program, I had the chance to take part in a lot
of different political discussions. And I remember this one conversation
about the death penalty in particular. So back then, I wholeheartedly believed
in this meaning of an eye for an eye. That punishment should be equal
to the offense because, you know, that's what I grew up hearing. And so I argued the same. I was, however, met
with immediate opposition. My peers told me that the death penalty
is state sanctioned murder and that it reinforces the very behavior
that it's trying to suppress. I tried arguing that the death
penalty deters crime, but then my peers told me that in states
without the death penalty, the murder rate is actually
significantly lower. I then tried arguing that the death
penalty brings closure for the victim's families, only to be told that the length
between sentencing and execution actually puts the victim's families
through an agonizing wait period. So by this point, I realized
that this debate -- Not going all that great for me. I realized that my
perspective was inherited, and this is when I decided
to stop trying to win the debate, and instead I just listened. 03:33And in the months that followed,
I took it upon myself to learn more. I pored over articles and data from sources ranging
from the more liberal, like the Brennan Center for Justice, to the more conservative,
like The Heritage Foundation. And I learned that historically, capital punishment has been
disproportionately applied to people of color. And that the death penalty
isn’t actually proven to deter crime. Slowly, my thinking changed. And this change only happened because I engaged with people
who had opposing perspectives. You know, it's hard to break out
of your own echo chamber because most of the time we don't realize
that we're even in one until we're out of it. But this was my first step. 04:21So shortly after this experience, I started a nonpartisan initiative
called Project TEAL to encourage and empower
high school students to become politically involved. We discuss a lot of different issues
like education equity, voter suppression, racial justice. And I've seen some amazing things happen when people just talk to one another. Understanding and accepting
of our differences. 04:48I actually remember this one conversation
in the summer of 2020. There was a boy and a girl
who were debating the merit of the Black Lives
Matter movement. And I remember being afraid that their conversation
would evolve into an argument. But it didn't. Instead, I learned
that the girl, who is Black, came from a family that had been through a couple
of rough instances with the police. And the boy, who was the son of a cop, came from an upbringing in which BLM was labeled
as a movement in defiance of the police. Later on, I was surprised to learn
that, though they still didn't agree, the boy and the girl learned something about the other
that they didn't know before. And more than that, they appreciated how it shaped the other person's
unique perspective. And this was only possible because they didn't delve
into a shouting match or call each other disrespectful names. And for me, this was an “aha!” moment. I realized that we shouldn't back away
from discussing polarizing issues, even if it's with people
who disagree with us. Sure, it's uncomfortable, and yeah, I'd probably agree that we don't change our minds
most of the time. But we can better understand
opposing perspectives, which can help us to better advocate
for our own beliefs. And maybe, just maybe, it even allows us to reach a compromise when the situation demands it. 06:16So I think the question remains. How can we create space
for this kind of bipartisan discourse? Well, I think the first step
is finding a community. When I think back
to my experience in the ACLU, I think the reason we were able
to have that civil discourse was because we recognized
that we were a part of a greater cause. And it's because my peers knew me, not just as an opposing voice, but as Shreya, their peer, their fellow
teen activist and their friend. And when we are able
to recognize what unites us, it becomes so much easier
to have conversations about what divides us. And most Americans actually validate
what I have seen in practice. While 77 percent of American voters polled before the 2020
presidential election said that they had just a few
or no close friends who supported the other side's candidate, 79 percent of Americans agree that creating opportunities
for bipartisan civil discourse would be effective in reducing divisions. Seventy-nine percent. That's pretty incredible, if you ask me. 07:28We all have affinity groups
that we can join. Maybe it's a friend group
at your place of work, a book club at the local library
or the PTA at your kid's school. Whatever this group is, try to have an uncomfortable conversation
with them at least once a week. Now, OK, what exactly constitutes
as uncomfortable? I would say that's really
up for you to decide. It can be about politics, sure. Or it can be about a different
topic entirely, like religion or identity. Whatever this topic may be, just talk about something
that’s uncomfortable, unconventional and meaningful to you. And most importantly, do it with the intent to listen and learn, not to win and not to agree. And you know, another tip. Make sure to stay off of your phone
for this conversation. Yeah. You know, as someone
who's pretty much obsessed with TikTok, I completely understand how addicting
social media can be. Believe me. But by discussing polarizing
issues online, we lose that person-to-person connection that really humanizes
opposing perspectives, that allows us to see
and empathize with one another. Because by having these conversations, you will gain insight into people
who think differently than you do. And who knows, maybe
you'll convince someone of a belief that you hold dearly, or maybe you'll even be moved
to reconsider your own viewpoint. 09:03In a month's time, I'm going to be
graduating from high school. 09:06(Applause) 09:11Over the past four years, I’ve learned a lot about creating
positive discourse, but I’m still scared of this polarization, this growing unwillingness to view
those who politically disagree with us as human. Honestly, it's a little overwhelming to think that I'm soon
going to enter this reality where I'll be confronted
with this division. Where I’ll be stereotyped and judged
by my ideology, my identity and my way of thinking by people
who don't even know the real me. As a teenager, it's a lot. And I know that many of my fellow
Gen Zers feel the exact same way. And this is precisely why addressing
this polarization crisis is so urgent and demands action from all of us. 10:02Just for one moment, go back to that high school cafeteria, But this time you sit down
with that other crowd. The kids who didn't look
or think like you do. And just imagine
what you could have learned. 10:17Thank you. 10:18(Applause) "

place in our life stories. What is it about these connections
that make them so unique? Before we dive into the science, 
let’s first observe one in action. 00:20If I could somehow design
a best friend, you know, put together all the ideal qualities
of my perfect match, that person would pale 
in comparison to Priya. 00:29She can turn any situation 
into a good time— chemistry lab, band practice. What I’m trying to say is I never laugh
harder than when I’m with Priya. 00:39And she’s always there for me. Like last year after I got dumped by Te—
you know what? I don’t even want to mention their name. It felt like my whole world
was crashing down. But as soon as I told Priya, boom,
she was at my door. I was a wreck, 
but she sat there with me and listened. 00:56We’re always on the same page; it’s as if we can read each other’s minds! And we can talk for hours— about anything. I know my mom would say she has
the phone bills to prove it. 01:08If it seems like friendships formed
in adolescence are particularly special, that’s because they are. Early childhood, adolescent, 
and adult friendships all manifest a little differently in part because the brain works 
in different ways at those stages of life. Adolescence is a unique time when
peer relationships take focus, and thanks to the developing brain, there are changes in the way you value, 
understand, and connect to friends. 01:34Teenage friends can seem
attached at the hip. Scientists describe adolescence
as a social reorientation as teenagers begin to spend 
as much or more time with their friends 
than with their parents. This drive to hang with pals may be due 
to changes in the brain’s reward center, known as the ventral striatum. Its activation makes hanging
out with others enjoyable and motivates you to spend
more time with them. Neuroimaging studies show that this region
is highly reactive during your teenage years, which may explain why adolescents 
seem to place a higher value on social interactions 
than children or adults. 02:11Teenage friendships can also
feel more intimate than the friendships of your childhood. This deeper connection is possible thanks
to improvements in what scientists call Theory of Mind. Theory of Mind is the ability 
to understand others’ emotions, thoughts, motivations, and points of view, and to realize that they may
be different from your own. While it may seem intuitive, this ability hinges on the careful
coordination of various brain regions, sometimes referred to as the social brain. Babies begin to develop Theory of Mind
around 18 months or so. Before that, it’s thought they believe
that everyone perceives and knows exactly what they know. It was once considered to be 
fully developed by age five, but scientists now know 
that Theory of Mind continues to improve and mature
well into your teenage years and beyond. Likewise, regions within the social brain
show increased connectivity during adolescence compared 
with childhood. As a result, teens can better understand
their friend’s perspectives, allowing for deeper connections 
to flourish. 03:15In the closest friendships, it can almost feel as if you’re
metaphysically connected— two bodies and minds, perfectly in sync. And there is science to this! Your ability to connect with others
somewhat depends on the coordination of actions, emotions,
physiology, and thoughts. This is what psychologists call
interpersonal synchrony. You first show signs of the ability
to sync with others as infants— synchronizing movements 
and babbling with your parents. As you get older and spend more time 
outside the home, you increasingly show this synchrony
with your peers. For example, imagine walking
down the street with a friend. Often without consciously thinking, you stroll at the same pace
and follow the same path. You and your best friend may 
not be only on the same page, but also scientifically, in step. "

In this moving and deeply personal talk, Senghor and Roberts share their approach to co-parenting -- an equal, active partnership that rolls with the punches and revels in the delights of guiding their child through the world with thought and intention.", (65K),"Transcript (16 Languages)Bahasa IndonesiaEnglishEspañolFrançaisItalianoPortuguês brasileiroPortuguês de PortugalRomânăTiếng ViệtTürkçeРусскийالعربيةမြန်မာဘာသာ中文 (简体)日本語한국어Ivana Korom, TranslatorJoanna Pietrulewicz, Reviewer00:01Ebony Roberts: I remember
watching my father raise the pistol to my mother's head. She pleaded with him to put the gun down, but he ignored her. When she bolted toward the door,
he followed close behind and once outside,
he fired one single shot. I was 12. I remember this moment frame by frame. I remember feeling numb. I remember feeling alone. 00:34Thank God, the bullet missed her, but my family would never be the same. I would never be the same. I didn't know then all the ways that my parents' on-again,
off-again relationship would impact me, but I knew I didn't want
a love like theirs. My story would be different. 00:57Years later, when I met you, I fell madly in love. Our connection was undeniable. It was as if you had been
hand-picked just for me. I thought we'd be together forever. But we struggled with some
of the same issues my parents had, and after nearly nine years together, we called it quits. 01:19We had Sekou then. He was only three. Though he was too young
to really understand what was going on, he was old enough to know that mommy and daddy were not going to be living
in the same house anymore. 01:33Our breakup hit me really hard. But I decided I wouldn't let my broken heart
get in the way of what was best for Sekou. We struggled initially,
trying to navigate this new space as co-parents. I asked myself, how do we raise this beautiful boy
full of wonder and promise and so much power, in spite of our failures as a couple? The answer for me was simple. I could either choose fear, fear of being alone, fear of the unknown, or choose love. And I chose love. That means seeing
the good in you as a father. It means seeing
the good in you as a father and not your missteps as a partner. It means putting Sekou first every time, even if it means I don't get my way. 02:33I know my parents went back and forth trying to work things out
for my brother and I's sake. Though I appreciate their effort, I wish they hadn't. I saw too much, I heard too much. I knew I didn't want
that to be Sekou's story. I wanted Sekou to know what it was like to see
two parents who got along, two parents who worked together as a team. I wanted him to know what love looks like in its truest form. Love is patient, love is kind. Love does not anger easily, it keeps no wrongs. Love always protects, always trusts, always hopes,
always perseveres. 03:25Shaka Senghor: It was 1983. I was 11 years old. I remember being in a basement
with my father, in our home on the east side of Detroit. I watched him stuff albums into the blue and orange milk crates, as tears streamed from his eyes. Just before that, him and my mother had just sat me and my siblings down and told us that they
were calling it quits. Thirty years later, I found myself with tears in my eyes, as I packed my belongings in our home. 04:11Ebony and I met while I was serving
a 19-year prison sentence. For four years, we used letters, phone calls and visits to build what we had imagined
to be an unshakeable bond. We fought the system together, and we thought that we would be able
to right the wrongs of our parents. She was a poet, I was a writer. She was gorgeous, with a PhD. I was handsome, with a GED. 04:49(Laughter) 04:53We built something magical. We built something
that we thought would endure. But unfortunately, our relationship became unhinged
when I was released from prison. Post-traumatic stress syndrome, trauma from prior to going to prison, baggage from her relationship, my inexperience in a relationship undid the magic of what we built
behind the walls. Centered in all of that was our beautiful boy. 05:32I remember when we first
brought Sekou home. It was so exciting, it was amazing, we worked together, we collaborated, we supported each other. You took the night shift,
I took the morning shift. And it was going amazing. And then it all changed. It changed the morning that you came in
really excited, you was like, ""Hey, I'm going back to work! Aren't you excited?"" And I was like, ""Yes.
I am ecstatic right now. 06:02(Laughter) 06:03I cannot be more delighted."" But inside, I was really afraid. But I couldn't tell you that. So instead, I said, ""Hey, go off and have a wonderful day."" 06:20And you left, and I was left with Sekou. What I understand now about that moment is that we were fostering a trust that's necessary for parents to coexist. And that you were trusting me
with our most precious gift. And that you were building the foundation
and the blocks for what's important for this portal we call parenthood. 06:48ER: Knowing how our parents'
breakups impacted us, you know, we were really sensitive about how our breakup would impact Sekou. We struggled, but we found our way. And let Sekou tell it, we're the best parents in the world. I love that he sees us that way. We made a choice in the beginning to co-parent as allies 
and not adversaries. To break the toxic pattern that we see play out over and over again when parents lose focus
on what's most important, the children. They allow their relationship pain
to get in the way. But at the end of the day,
we're on the same team, and that's Sekou's team. 07:35You know, I have to admit, we have an unconventional relationship a lot of people don't understand. We're not perfect as parents or people. But we honor each other's role
in Sekou's life. We allow him to do things that our parents
would never allow us to do. We don't allow our fears
to put limits on him. We nurture his natural curiosity
about the universe and his relationship to the world. 08:05Remember that time when we were
coming in from a long day at work, and Sekou found a puddle outside, a puddle of mud, mind you. Had a brand new fresh outfit on,
Levi's from head to toe. And he found this puddle of mud,
and he reached for it. And he wanted to touch the muddy earth,
and we allowed him to do that. We resisted the urge to say no, and in fact, went and got him a shovel, and allowed him
to feel the earth's properties and explore as much
as he wanted to, and he played, and was as happy as a pig in mud. 08:36(Laughter) 08:37We realized that the outfit
could be washed, that a bath would clean up all the dirt, but the thrill of being in the moment, of being able to touch and be amazed at this thing
that he had never discovered before was more valuable than the clothes
or the dirt that could be washed away. 08:56We continue to rethink
what is right and wrong when it comes to parenting. Sekou challenges us every day. You know, we allow him to climb on couches and draw on his clothes and his shoes, let him run around the store --
well, I do, anyway. And I get the death stares
from other mamas who look at me and who think that children should be
quiet and well-behaved in public. 09:25I also get those questions
that are really judgments, but I don't pay them any mind. Because at the end of the day, our job is to guide Sekou
on this journey of life, not to control him. We're here to help him
figure out his place in the world, to uncover his greatest gifts, to discover why he was born. We are raising a free black boy in a world that despises black joy, and we refuse to put limits on him
that the world already has. 10:00SS: Our parenting
can be seen as an allegory for this two-sided coin of possibilities. On one side, the reality of raising
a black boy in a society that says that black boys,
black bodies and black lives only seen as profitable or disposable. And then there's the other side. Possibility of two parents
who are no longer together coexisting, supporting each other, loving each other,
showing affection publicly in a way that honors
the relationship with our son. And even more importantly is the power to support each other
in all those vulnerable moments. 10:43There was this one time that it was my day to go pick up Sekou,
you remember that time? I go pick Sekou up, he's in first grade, and as I'm walking up, another parent walks up
and says, ""Hey, Shaka. I seen Oprah Winfrey
give a shout-out to you on CNN last night."" She was super excited, exuberant even. I was mortified. Because I thought, what's going to happen
when she tells another parent, and they tell another parent, and then they go and look me up and then they discover that I was in prison
for second-degree murder. And then their child hears about it. And they come to school,
and they say to Sekou, ""Your dad was convicted
of murdering someone."" And I remember,
as watching Sekou race out, and I knew that I had to call Ebony. When I called her,
I explained to her what happened, Ebony said, ""You have to have the talk."" 11:44So I took Sekou home, got him ready for bed, and we talked for half an hour. I talked to him
about why I went to prison. And I listened to his feedback. And then we called his mom
so we can do our nightly ritual of her offering prayer and then me doing affirmations. And I remember holding him tightly. And I realized the importance
of the affirmations that we do at night. And I see them as a road map, as a guide, as a touchstone
for other parents to protect and to empower their children, especially in a world
where it's very difficult. 12:26For us, co-parenting is so much more than scheduling pick-up and drop-off, playdates, deciding what he's going to wear,
what he's going to eat. For us, it's about helping
each other carry the weight, unpack the load, and to show up in the world
in a way that honors the beauty of our son. And it's for these reasons
that we do affirmations. 12:52ER: We never though we'd be here. But here we are. And we hope that the way
that we show up for Sekou and for each other is a model of what successful
co-parenting can look like. We'd like to bring you all in
to this nightly ritual of affirmations that Shaka does with Sekou
every night at bedtime. 13:14SS: Hey. 13:16(Applause) 13:23SS: I am great.
Sekou: I am great. 13:25SS: I am awesome.
Sekou: I am awesome. 13:27SS: I'm amazing.
Sekou: I'm amazing. 13:28SS: I am thoughtful.
Sekou: I am thoughtful. 13:31SS: I am kind.
Sekou: I am kind. 13:32SS: I am loving.
Sekou: I am loving. 13:34SS: I am caring.
Sekou: I am caring. 13:35SS: I am funny.
Sekou: I am funny. 13:37SS: I'm smart.
Sekou: I'm smart. 13:39SS: I'm a big boy.
Sekou: I'm a big boy. 13:41SS: I'm a soldier.
Sekou: I'm a soldier. 13:43SS: I'm a warrior.
Sekou: I'm a warrior. 13:44SS: I am Sekou.
Sekou: I am Sekou. 13:46(Cheers and applause) 13:52ER: Good job, baby. "

of the affirmations that we do at night. And I see them as a road map, as a guide, as a touchstone
for other parents to protect and to empower their children, especially in a world
where it's very difficult. 12:26For us, co-parenting is so much more than scheduling pick-up and drop-off, playdates, deciding what he's going to wear,
what he's going to eat. For us, it's about helping
each other carry the weight, unpack the load, and to show up in the world
in a way that honors the beauty of our son. And it's for these reasons
that we do affirmations. 12:52ER: We never though we'd be here. But here we are. And we hope that the way
that we show up for Sekou and for each other is a model of what successful
co-parenting can look like. We'd like to bring you all in
to this nightly ritual of affirmations that Shaka does with Sekou
every night at bedtime. 13:14SS: Hey. 13:16(Applause) 13:23SS: I am great.
Sekou: I am great. 13:25SS: I am awesome.
Sekou: I am awesome. 13:27SS: I'm amazing.

2,Why domestic violence victims don't leave,Leslie Morgan Steiner,Jan 2013,"Leslie Morgan Steiner was in ""crazy love"" -- that is, madly in love with a man who routinely abused her and threatened her life.

My topic is the secrets of domestic violence, and the question I'm going to tackle is the one question everyone always asks: Why does she stay? Why would anyone stay with a man who beats her? I'm not a psychiatrist, a social worker or an expert in domestic violence. I'm just one woman with a story to tell. 00:31I was 22. I had just graduated from Harvard College. I had moved to New York City for my first job as a writer and editor at Seventeen magazine. I had my first apartment, my first little green American Express card, and I had a very big secret. My secret was that I had this gun loaded with hollow-point bullets pointed at my head by the man who I thought was my soulmate, many, many times. The man who I loved more than anybody on Earth held a gun to my head and threatened to kill me more times than I can even remember. I'm here to tell you the story of crazy love, a psychological trap disguised as love, one that millions of women and even a few men fall into every year. It may even be your story. 01:28I don't look like a typical domestic violence survivor. I have a B.A. in English from Harvard College, an MBA in marketing from Wharton Business School. I've spent most of my career working for Fortune 500 companies including Johnson &amp; Johnson, Leo Burnett and The Washington Post. I've been married for almost 20 years to my second husband and we have three kids together. My dog is a black lab, and I drive a Honda Odyssey minivan. (Laughter) 01:57So my first message for you is that domestic violence happens to everyone -- all races, all religions, all income and education levels. It's everywhere. And my second message is that everyone thinks domestic violence happens to women, that it's a women's issue. Not exactly. Over 85 percent of abusers are men, and domestic abuse happens only in intimate, interdependent, long-term relationships, in other words, in families, the last place we would want or expect to find violence, which is one reason domestic abuse is so confusing. 02:37I would have told you myself that I was the last person on Earth who would stay with a man who beats me, but in fact I was a very typical victim because of my age. I was 22, and in the United States, women ages 16 to 24 are three times as likely to be domestic violence victims as women of other ages, and over 500 women and girls this age are killed every year by abusive partners, boyfriends, and husbands in the United States. 03:11I was also a very typical victim because I knew nothing about domestic violence, its warning signs or its patterns. 03:19I met Conor on a cold, rainy January night. He sat next to me on the New York City subway, and he started chatting me up. He told me two things. One was that he, too, had just graduated from an Ivy League school, and that he worked at a very impressive Wall Street bank. But what made the biggest impression on me that first meeting was that he was smart and funny and he looked like a farm boy. He had these big cheeks, these big apple cheeks and this wheat-blond hair, and he seemed so sweet. 03:54One of the smartest things Conor did, from the very beginning, was to create the illusion that I was the dominant partner in the relationship. He did this especially at the beginning by idolizing me. We started dating, and he loved everything about me, that I was smart, that I'd gone to Harvard, that I was passionate about helping teenage girls, and my job. He wanted to know everything about my family and my childhood and my hopes and dreams. Conor believed in me, as a writer and a woman, in a way that no one else ever had. And he also created a magical atmosphere of trust between us by confessing his secret, which was that, as a very young boy starting at age four, he had been savagely and repeatedly physically abused by his stepfather, and the abuse had gotten so bad that he had had to drop out of school in eighth grade, even though he was very smart, and he'd spent almost 20 years rebuilding his life. Which is why that Ivy League degree and the Wall Street job and his bright shiny future meant so much to him. If you had told me that this smart, funny, sensitive man who adored me would one day dictate whether or not I wore makeup, how short my skirts were, where I lived, what jobs I took, who my friends were and where I spent Christmas, I would have laughed at you, because there was not a hint of violence or control or anger in Conor at the beginning. I didn't know that the first stage in any domestic violence relationship is to seduce and charm the victim. 05:40I also didn't know that the second step is to isolate the victim. Now, Conor did not come home one day and announce, ""You know, hey, all this Romeo and Juliet stuff has been great, but I need to move into the next phase where I isolate you and I abuse you"" — (Laughter) — ""so I need to get you out of this apartment where the neighbors can hear you scream and out of this city where you have friends and family and coworkers who can see the bruises."" Instead, Conor came home one Friday evening and he told me that he had quit his job that day, his dream job, and he said that he had quit his job because of me, because I had made him feel so safe and loved that he didn't need to prove himself on Wall Street anymore, and he just wanted to get out of the city and away from his abusive, dysfunctional family, and move to a tiny town in New England where he could start his life over with me by his side. Now, the last thing I wanted to do was leave New York, and my dream job, but I thought you made sacrifices for your soulmate, so I agreed, and I quit my job, and Conor and I left Manhattan together. I had no idea I was falling into crazy love, that I was walking headfirst into a carefully laid physical, financial and psychological trap. 07:09The next step in the domestic violence pattern is to introduce the threat of violence and see how she reacts. And here's where those guns come in. As soon as we moved to New England -- you know, that place where Connor was supposed to feel so safe -- he bought three guns. He kept one in the glove compartment of our car. He kept one under the pillows on our bed, and the third one he kept in his pocket at all times. And he said that he needed those guns because of the trauma he'd experienced as a young boy. He needed them to feel protected. But those guns were really a message for me, and even though he hadn't raised a hand to me, my life was already in grave danger every minute of every day. 07:57Conor first physically attacked me five days before our wedding. It was 7 a.m. I still had on my nightgown. I was working on my computer trying to finish a freelance writing assignment, and I got frustrated, and Conor used my anger as an excuse to put both of his hands around my neck and to squeeze so tightly that I could not breathe or scream, and he used the chokehold to hit my head repeatedly against the wall. Five days later, the ten bruises on my neck had just faded, and I put on my mother's wedding dress, and I married him. 08:40Despite what had happened, I was sure we were going to live happily ever after, because I loved him, and he loved me so much. And he was very, very sorry. He had just been really stressed out by the wedding and by becoming a family with me. It was an isolated incident, and he was never going to hurt me again. 09:04It happened twice more on the honeymoon. The first time, I was driving to find a secret beach and I got lost, and he punched me in the side of my head so hard that the other side of my head repeatedly hit the driver's side window. And then a few days later, driving home from our honeymoon, he got frustrated by traffic, and he threw a cold Big Mac in my face. Conor proceeded to beat me once or twice a week for the next two and a half years of our marriage. 09:35I was mistaken in thinking that I was unique and alone in this situation. One in three American women experiences domestic violence or stalking at some point in her life, and the CDC reports that 15 million children are abused every year, 15 million. So actually, I was in very good company. 09:58Back to my question: Why did I stay? The answer is easy. I didn't know he was abusing me. Even though he held those loaded guns to my head, pushed me down stairs, threatened to kill our dog, pulled the key out of the car ignition as I drove down the highway, poured coffee grinds on my head as I dressed for a job interview, I never once thought of myself as a battered wife. Instead, I was a very strong woman in love with a deeply troubled man, and I was the only person on Earth who could help Conor face his demons. 10:40The other question everybody asks is, why doesn't she just leave? Why didn't I walk out? I could have left any time. To me, this is the saddest and most painful question that people ask, because we victims know something you usually don't: It's incredibly dangerous to leave an abuser. Because the final step in the domestic violence pattern is kill her. Over 70 percent of domestic violence murders happen after the victim has ended the relationship, after she's gotten out, because then the abuser has nothing left to lose. Other outcomes include long-term stalking, even after the abuser remarries; denial of financial resources; and manipulation of the family court system to terrify the victim and her children, who are regularly forced by family court judges to spend unsupervised time with the man who beat their mother. And still we ask, why doesn't she just leave? 11:49I was able to leave, because of one final, sadistic beating that broke through my denial. I realized that the man who I loved so much was going to kill me if I let him. So I broke the silence. I told everyone: the police, my neighbors, my friends and family, total strangers, and I'm here today because you all helped me. 12:22We tend to stereotype victims as grisly headlines, self-destructive women, damaged goods. The question, ""Why does she stay?"" is code for some people for, ""It's her fault for staying,"" as if victims intentionally choose to fall in love with men intent upon destroying us. 12:46But since publishing ""Crazy Love,"" I have heard hundreds of stories from men and women who also got out, who learned an invaluable life lesson from what happened, and who rebuilt lives -- joyous, happy lives -- as employees, wives and mothers, lives completely free of violence, like me. Because it turns out that I'm actually a very typical domestic violence victim and a typical domestic violence survivor. I remarried a kind and gentle man, and we have those three kids. I have that black lab, and I have that minivan. What I will never have again, ever, is a loaded gun held to my head by someone who says that he loves me. 13:39Right now, maybe you're thinking, ""Wow, this is fascinating,"" or, ""Wow, how stupid was she,"" but this whole time, I've actually been talking about you. I promise you there are several people listening to me right now who are currently being abused or who were abused as children or who are abusers themselves. Abuse could be affecting your daughter, your sister, your best friend right now. 14:14I was able to end my own crazy love story by breaking the silence. I'm still breaking the silence today. It's my way of helping other victims, and it's my final request of you. Talk about what you heard here. Abuse thrives only in silence. You have the power to end domestic violence simply by shining a spotlight on it. We victims need everyone. We need every one of you to understand the secrets of domestic violence. Show abuse the light of day by talking about it with your children, your coworkers, your friends and family. Recast survivors as wonderful, lovable people with full futures. Recognize the early signs of violence and conscientiously intervene, deescalate it, show victims a safe way out. Together we can make our beds, our dinner tables and our families the safe and peaceful oases they should be. 15:29Thank you. 15:31(Applause) "
2,How peer educators can transform sex education,Thea Holcomb,Feb 2019,"Where are teens supposed to learn about sex, asks student speaker Thea Holcomb. From alarmist imagery about sexually transmitted diseases? From the Internet and all its attendant judgment, bias and dysfunction? The answer, she suggests, lies with peer educators. In this talk, Holcomb explains why properly trained peer educators are the right people to disseminate both accurate information and healthy attitudes. As she says, ""When you get accurate, judgment-free information from yo...", (9.7K),"Transcript (5 Languages)EnglishEspañolPortuguês brasileiroРусскийالعربيةDang Nguyen, TranslatorPeter Van de Ven, Reviewer00:02Greetings audience,
I'm Thea, I'm a high school student, and today we're going to talk about sex. [It won't be too scary.] Operating on the assumption you're human,
you've certainly heard of sex. In case you haven't, 
to get you up to speed, sex is the process
by which many organisms ensure their continued existence. Here's the thing though: sex is more complicated than that because - spoiler alert! -
humans are complicated. So how do we learn about sex
if it's so complicated? You might remember
sex education like this: [Don't have sex;
you will get PREGNANT and die.] Urban Dictionary - your source
for news and information about the 21st century zeitgeist -
describes sex education as:
 "".. where they try to
scare you out of having sex with pictures of diseased genitals..."" A more hopeful description
of sex education would be something like: a lifelong process of learning
about sex and sexuality, exploring values and beliefs
and gaining skills to navigate relationships
and manage your sexual health. This, as far as I'm concerned,
is a solid definition. So what can we do to make
sex education something that teens find
actually, like, educational. Clearly, teens need answers
to their questions. Where do people go
when they have questions? [The Internet] Listen, I love the Internet. It's one of the greatest developments
in human information exchange. [Yes. Thanks Internet.] But what it says about sexual health is not accurate by any
stretch of the imagination or is so laden with bias that it feels
more like being pelted with judgement than actually receiving information. Unfortunately, not every teen
is willing and able to chat it up with
their parents about sex. So if not always the Internet,
where can teens turn? Enter the peer educator. People my age do, indeed,
talk to each other about sex. So when teens are sources
of accurate information, it spreads among us quickly. As a peer educator, I belong to a program that gives me the tools
to learn about everything from STIs and safe sex
to contraception and consent. Basically, I can tell you more about
human sexuality than the average adult. When teens see someone like me
instead of someone older, they're quite open to the information
I have to offer them. At lunch once, some friends
wanted to know the difference between hormonal and copper IUDs. So I brought this to the table. Another day, my teacher didn't understand
how emergency contraception works. So I explained it to the class. What does it look like when teens
ask me questions about sexual health? It goes something like this. Venereal disease, STD, STI?
This terminology, it baffles me. STI stands for sexually
transmitted infection. We used to say STD, which stood
for sexually transmitted disease, but it was changed recently because STI is a more
medically accurate term, and taking away
the big scary word ""disease"" helps decrease stigma. What the heck is trichomoniasis? Well, trichomoniasis is a STI usually
spread through vaginal intercourse. It's curable with just
one dose of an oral drug. Common symptoms,
regardless of a person's sex, are unusual discharge,
painful urination and itching. But it spreads really quickly because most of the time
it's asymptomatic, which means people
don't realize they have it. That's why it's so important
to get tested regularly. Is it OK to be gay? Yes, all people of all identities
and backgrounds, including on the LGBTQ+ spectrum, can live healthy and productive lives. Regardless of your beliefs, everyone has the right to explore
and express their sexuality without the fear of shame or judgement. Thanks! So often, when my peers approach me
with questions like these, seeking this or that piece of information, at least a sliver of what they're
wondering is: ""Am I normal?"" So let's talk about normal. Part of the point of peer education is to give teens
the opportunity to understand that there is no such thing
as the elusive ""normal."" Peer educators are here to say
they're armed with information that empowers you
to make informed decisions; you are going to be OK. ""Normal"" isn't really necessary. When you can get accurate, judgement-free information
from your peers, you realize that sex-ed
doesn't have to be scary. So instead of striving to be normal, let's talk to each other. Since peer education allows sex-ed
to reach the community in ways that go far beyond
pictures of diseased genitals, it turns out to be pretty brilliant. An idea that, unlike trichomoniasis,
is certainly worth spreading. "
2,An ode to envy,Parul Sehgal,Oct 2013,"What is jealousy? What drives it, and why do we secretly love it? No study has ever been able to capture its ""loneliness, longevity, grim thrill"" -- that is, says Parul Sehgal, except for fiction. In an eloquent meditation she scours pages from literature to show how jealousy is not so different from a quest for knowledge.", (73K),"Transcript (31 Languages)DeutschEnglishEspañolFrançaisHrvatskiItalianoLatviešuLietuvių kalbaMagyarNederlandsPolskiPortuguês brasileiroPortuguês de PortugalRomânăSlovenčinaSlovenščinaSvenskaTiếng ViệtTürkçeČeštinaΕλληνικάРусскийСрпски, SrpskiУкраїнськабългарскиעבריתالعربية中文 (简体)中文 (繁體)日本語한국어00:01So when I was eight years old, a new girl came to join the class, and she was so impressive, as the new girl always seems to be. She had vast quantities of very shiny hair and a cute little pencil case, super strong on state capitals, just a great speller. And I just curdled with jealousy that year, until I hatched my devious plan. So one day I stayed a little late after school, a little too late, and I lurked in the girls' bathroom. When the coast was clear, I emerged, crept into the classroom, and took from my teacher's desk the grade book. And then I did it. I fiddled with my rival's grades, just a little, just demoted some of those A's. All of those A's. (Laughter) And I got ready to return the book to the drawer, when hang on, some of my other classmates had appallingly good grades too. So, in a frenzy, I corrected everybody's marks, not imaginatively. I gave everybody a row of D's and I gave myself a row of A's, just because I was there, you know, might as well. 01:22And I am still baffled by my behavior. I don't understand where the idea came from. I don't understand why I felt so great doing it. I felt great. I don't understand why I was never caught. I mean, it should have been so blatantly obvious. I was never caught. But most of all, I am baffled by, why did it bother me so much that this little girl, this tiny little girl, was so good at spelling? Jealousy baffles me. It's so mysterious, and it's so pervasive. We know babies suffer from jealousy. We know primates do. Bluebirds are actually very prone. We know that jealousy is the number one cause of spousal murder in the United States. And yet, I have never read a study that can parse to me its loneliness or its longevity or its grim thrill. For that, we have to go to fiction, because the novel is the lab that has studied jealousy in every possible configuration. In fact, I don't know if it's an exaggeration to say that if we didn't have jealousy, would we even have literature? Well no faithless Helen, no ""Odyssey."" No jealous king, no ""Arabian Nights."" No Shakespeare. There goes high school reading lists, because we're losing ""Sound and the Fury,"" we're losing ""Gatsby,"" ""Sun Also Rises,"" we're losing ""Madame Bovary,"" ""Anna K."" No jealousy, no Proust. And now, I mean, I know it's fashionable to say that Proust has the answers to everything, but in the case of jealousy, he kind of does. This year is the centennial of his masterpiece, ""In Search of Lost Time,"" and it's the most exhaustive study of sexual jealousy and just regular competitiveness, my brand, that we can hope to have. (Laughter) And we think about Proust, we think about the sentimental bits, right? We think about a little boy trying to get to sleep. We think about a madeleine moistened in lavender tea. We forget how harsh his vision was. We forget how pitiless he is. I mean, these are books that Virginia Woolf said were tough as cat gut. I don't know what cat gut is, but let's assume it's formidable. 03:41Let's look at why they go so well together, the novel and jealousy, jealousy and Proust. Is it something as obvious as that jealousy, which boils down into person, desire, impediment, is such a solid narrative foundation? I don't know. I think it cuts very close to the bone, because let's think about what happens when we feel jealous. When we feel jealous, we tell ourselves a story. We tell ourselves a story about other people's lives, and these stories make us feel terrible because they're designed to make us feel terrible. As the teller of the tale and the audience, we know just what details to include, to dig that knife in. Right? Jealousy makes us all amateur novelists, and this is something Proust understood. 04:32In the first volume, Swann's Way, the series of books, Swann, one of the main characters, is thinking very fondly of his mistress and how great she is in bed, and suddenly, in the course of a few sentences, and these are Proustian sentences, so they're long as rivers, but in the course of a few sentences, he suddenly recoils and he realizes, ""Hang on, everything I love about this woman, somebody else would love about this woman. Everything that she does that gives me pleasure could be giving somebody else pleasure, maybe right about now."" And this is the story he starts to tell himself, and from then on, Proust writes that every fresh charm Swann detects in his mistress, he adds to his ""collection of instruments in his private torture chamber."" 05:23Now Swann and Proust, we have to admit, were notoriously jealous. You know, Proust's boyfriends would have to leave the country if they wanted to break up with him. But you don't have to be that jealous to concede that it's hard work. Right? Jealousy is exhausting. It's a hungry emotion. It must be fed. 05:42And what does jealousy like? Jealousy likes information. Jealousy likes details. Jealousy likes the vast quantities of shiny hair, the cute little pencil case. Jealousy likes photos. That's why Instagram is such a hit. (Laughter) Proust actually links the language of scholarship and jealousy. When Swann is in his jealous throes, and suddenly he's listening at doorways and bribing his mistress' servants, he defends these behaviors. He says, ""You know, look, I know you think this is repugnant, but it is no different from interpreting an ancient text or looking at a monument."" He says, ""They are scientific investigations with real intellectual value."" Proust is trying to show us that jealousy feels intolerable and makes us look absurd, but it is, at its crux, a quest for knowledge, a quest for truth, painful truth, and actually, where Proust is concerned, the more painful the truth, the better. Grief, humiliation, loss: These were the avenues to wisdom for Proust. He says, ""A woman whom we need, who makes us suffer, elicits from us a gamut of feelings far more profound and vital than a man of genius who interests us."" Is he telling us to just go and find cruel women? No. I think he's trying to say that jealousy reveals us to ourselves. And does any other emotion crack us open in this particular way? Does any other emotion reveal to us our aggression and our hideous ambition and our entitlement? Does any other emotion teach us to look with such peculiar intensity? 07:34Freud would write about this later. One day, Freud was visited by this very anxious young man who was consumed with the thought of his wife cheating on him. And Freud says, it's something strange about this guy, because he's not looking at what his wife is doing. Because she's blameless; everybody knows it. The poor creature is just under suspicion for no cause. But he's looking for things that his wife is doing without noticing, unintentional behaviors. Is she smiling too brightly here, or did she accidentally brush up against a man there? [Freud] says that the man is becoming the custodian of his wife's unconscious. 08:10The novel is very good on this point. The novel is very good at describing how jealousy trains us to look with intensity but not accuracy. In fact, the more intensely jealous we are, the more we become residents of fantasy. And this is why, I think, jealousy doesn't just provoke us to do violent things or illegal things. Jealousy prompts us to behave in ways that are wildly inventive. Now I'm thinking of myself at eight, I concede, but I'm also thinking of this story I heard on the news. A 52-year-old Michigan woman was caught creating a fake Facebook account from which she sent vile, hideous messages to herself for a year. For a year. A year. And she was trying to frame her ex-boyfriend's new girlfriend, and I have to confess when I heard this, I just reacted with admiration. (Laughter) Because, I mean, let's be real. What immense, if misplaced, creativity. Right? This is something from a novel. This is something from a Patricia Highsmith novel. 09:25Now Highsmith is a particular favorite of mine. She is the very brilliant and bizarre woman of American letters. She's the author of ""Strangers on a Train"" and ""The Talented Mr. Ripley,"" books that are all about how jealousy, it muddles our minds, and once we're in the sphere, in that realm of jealousy, the membrane between what is and what could be can be pierced in an instant. Take Tom Ripley, her most famous character. Now, Tom Ripley goes from wanting you or wanting what you have to being you and having what you once had, and you're under the floorboards, he's answering to your name, he's wearing your rings, emptying your bank account. That's one way to go. 10:11But what do we do? We can't go the Tom Ripley route. I can't give the world D's, as much as I would really like to, some days. And it's a pity, because we live in envious times. We live in jealous times. I mean, we're all good citizens of social media, aren't we, where the currency is envy? 10:31Does the novel show us a way out? I'm not sure. So let's do what characters always do when they're not sure, when they are in possession of a mystery. Let's go to 221B Baker Street and ask for Sherlock Holmes. When people think of Holmes, they think of his nemesis being Professor Moriarty, right, this criminal mastermind. But I've always preferred [Inspector] Lestrade, who is the rat-faced head of Scotland Yard who needs Holmes desperately, needs Holmes' genius, but resents him. Oh, it's so familiar to me. So Lestrade needs his help, resents him, and sort of seethes with bitterness over the course of the mysteries. But as they work together, something starts to change, and finally in ""The Adventure of the Six Napoleons,"" once Holmes comes in, dazzles everybody with his solution, Lestrade turns to Holmes and he says, ""We're not jealous of you, Mr. Holmes. We're proud of you."" And he says that there's not a man at Scotland Yard who wouldn't want to shake Sherlock Holmes' hand. 11:39It's one of the few times we see Holmes moved in the mysteries, and I find it very moving, this little scene, but it's also mysterious, right? It seems to treat jealousy as a problem of geometry, not emotion. You know, one minute Holmes is on the other side from Lestrade. The next minute they're on the same side. Suddenly, Lestrade is letting himself admire this mind that he's resented. Could it be so simple though? What if jealousy really is a matter of geometry, just a matter of where we allow ourselves to stand in relation to another? Well, maybe then we wouldn't have to resent somebody's excellence. We could align ourselves with it. 12:19But I like contingency plans. So while we wait for that to happen, let us remember that we have fiction for consolation. Fiction alone demystifies jealousy. Fiction alone domesticates it, invites it to the table. And look who it gathers: sweet Lestrade, terrifying Tom Ripley, crazy Swann, Marcel Proust himself. We are in excellent company. Thank you.

my wife transformed before my eyes from this graceful, peaceful, sweet woman into just an angry mother grizzly bear
whose cubs needed to be protected. It was intense. So here's what happened. 00:28This is our family. This is my wife and I
and our five awesome kids. We're pretty loud,
we're pretty rambunctious, we're us. You'll notice, though,
that two of our children look a little different than Mary and I, and that's because they came to us
through adoption. Our neighbor, though,
saw two different-looking children playing outside of our house every day and came to the conclusion that we must have been running
an illegal day care out of our home. 00:54(Murmuring) 00:57We were really angry to have
our children stereotyped like that, but I know that's a relatively
minor example of racial profiling. But isn't it sometimes
what we all tend to do with people who think differently, or believe differently
or maybe even vote differently? Instead of engaging as true neighbors, we keep our distance and our actions towards those are guided by who we think
sees the world as we do or who we think doesn't. 01:28footnotefootnoteSee, what my neighbor suffered from
is a condition called agonism. And sometimes we all suffer
from the same condition. It's not a medical condition,
but it is contagious. So let's talk a little bit
about what agonism is. My favorite definition of agonism is taking a warlike stance
in contexts that are not literally war. Agonism comes from the same
Greek root word ""agon"" from which we get ""agony."" How very appropriate. We all tend to show symptoms of agonism when we hold on
to two deeply held beliefs, first identified by author Rick Warren. The first one is that if love someone, we must agree with all they do or believe. And the second is the inverse, that if we disagree with someone, it must mean that we fear or we hate them. 02:25Not sure we really recognize the agony
this way of thinking brings to us, when our relationships die because we think
we have to agree or disagree no matter what. Think about the conversations
we've had around Brexit, or Hong Kong, maybe Israeli settlements
or perhaps impeachment. I bet we could all think
of at least one personal relationship that's been strained or maybe even ended
because of these topics, or tragically, over a topic much more trivial than those. The cure for agonism is not out of reach. The question is how. 03:06So might I suggest two strategies that my experience
has taught me to start with. First, cultivate common ground, which means focusing on what we share. I want you to know I'm using my words
very, very deliberately. By ""cultivate,"" I mean
we have to intentionally work to find common ground with someone. Just like a farmer works
to cultivate the soil. And common ground is a common term, so let me at least explain
what I don't mean, which is I don't mean by common ground
that we were exact, or that we totally agree and approve. All I mean is that we find
one unifying thing that we can have in a relationship
in common with another person. 03:52You know, sometimes
that one thing is hard to find. So I'd like to share a personal story, but before I do, let me tell you a little bit
more about myself. I'm Caucasian, cisgender male, middle class, evangelical Christian. And I know, as soon as some
of those words came out of my mouth, some of you had some perceptions about me. And it's OK, I know that not all
those perceptions are positive. But for those who share my faith, know that I'm about
to cut across the grain. And you may tune me out as well. So as we go, if you're having a hard time hearing me, I just gently ask that you reflect and see if you're buying into agonism. If you're rejecting me simply because you think
you see the world differently than I do, because isn't that
what we're here talking about? Alright, ready? 04:44So I've been thinking a lot
about how to find common ground in the area of gender fluidity, as an evangelical Christian. For Christians like me, we believe that God
created us man and woman. So what do I do? Do I throw up my hands and say, ""I can't have a relationship
with anybody who is transgender or LGBTQIA?"" No. That would be giving into agonism. 05:12footnotefootnoteSo I started looking
at the foundational aspects of my faith, the first of which is that of the three billion genes
that make us human -- and by the way, we share
99.9 percent of those genes -- that I believe those three billion genes
are the result of an intelligent designer. And that immediately gives me
common ground with anybody. What it also gives me ... is the belief that each
and every one of us have been given the right to life by that same intelligent designer. 05:50I dug deeper though. I found that my faith didn't teach me to start relationships
by arguing with somebody until they believed what I believed, or I convinced them. No, it taught me to start relationships by loving them as a coequal member
of the human race. Honestly though, some who share my faith draw a line and refuse to address somebody
by their preferred gender pronoun. But isn't that believing the lie
that in order for me to honor you, I have to give up what I believe? 06:25Come back in time with me -- let's say it's 20 years ago, and Muhammad Ali comes to your doorstep. And you open the door. Would you address him as Muhammad Ali or his former name of Cassius Clay? I'm guessing that most of you
would say Muhammad Ali. And I'm also guessing that most of you wouldn't think we'd have to
immediately convert to Islam, just by using his name. To honor him would cost me,
would cost any of us absolutely nothing, and it would give us the common ground
to have a relationship. And it's the relationship
that cures agonism, not giving up what we believe. 07:09So for me to honor my faith, it means rejecting
these rigid symptoms of agonism. Meaning, I can and I will love you. I can and I will accept you, and I don't have to buy into the lie that if I do these things,
I have to give up what I believe or chose to fear and hate you. Because I'm focusing
on what we have in common. 07:35When you can find even the smallest bit
of common ground with somebody, it allows you to understand
just the beautiful wonder and complexity and majesty of the other person. 07:53Our second strategy gives us room to (Inhales) breathe. To pause. To calm down. To have the kind of relationships
that cure agonism. And how to keep those relationships alive. Our second strategy is to exchange
extravagant grace. 08:18(Laughs) 08:20Once again, I'm not mincing words -- by grace, I don't mean
we should all go sign up for ballet, that would be weird. 08:25(Laughter) 08:27footnotefootnoteWhat I mean is not canceling
everything over one mistake. Even if that mistake
personally offended you. Maybe even deeply. Perhaps Holocaust survivor
Corrie ten Boom put it best when she said, ""To forgive is to set a prisoner free, only to realize that prisoner was me."" My faith teaches me that we humans
will never be perfect, myself very much included. So we need the grace of a savior, who for me is Jesus. And while I define grace
in the context of my faith, I know there's a lot of other people
who have defined it differently and in different ways. One of my favorites is radio broadcaster
Oswald Hoffmann, who said, ""Grace is the love that loves the unlovely and the unlovable."" And I just love that picture of grace. Because I know I am, and maybe a lot of you can think of a time when we're just pretty dadgum unlovable. 09:37So it would be the height of hypocrisy, dare I say repulsive to my faith, for me to accept the unconditional, unqualified
grace and love from God and then turn around and put one precondition
on the love I give you. What in the world would I be thinking? And by extravagant, I mean over the top, not just checking a box. We can all remember when we were kids and our parents forced us
to apologize to somebody and we walked up to them
and said, (Angrily) ""I'm sorry."" We just got it over with, right? That's not what we're talking about. What we're talking about
is not having to give someone grace but choosing to and wanting to. That's how we exchange extravagant grace. 10:31Listen, I know this can sound
really, really theoretical. So I'd like to tell you
about a hero of mine. A hero of grace. It's 2014. In Iran. And the mother of a murdered son
is in a public square. The man who murdered her son
is also in that square, by a gallows, on a chair of some kind, a noose around his neck and a blindfold over his eyes. Samereh Alinejad had been given the sole right
under the laws of her country to either pardon this man or initiate his execution. Put another way, she could pardon him or literally push that chair
out from underneath his feet. 11:25(Exhales) 11:27I just ... I can't picture the agony
going through both Samereh and this man at the time. Samereh with her choice to make, and this man, in the account
that I read, was just weeping, just begging for forgiveness. And Samereh had a choice. And she chose in that moment
to walk up to this man and to slap him right across the face. And that signaled her pardon. It gets better. 11:58Right afterwards, somebody asked her, they interviewed her,
and she was quoted as saying, ""I felt as if rage vanished
from within my heart and the blood in my veins
began to flow again."" Isn't that incredible? I mean, what a picture of grace,
what a hero of grace. And there's a lesson in there
for all of us. That as theologian John Piper said, ""Grace is power, not just pardon."" And if you think about it, grace is the gift we give
someone else in a relationship that says our relationship
is way more important than the things that separate us. And if you really think
about it some more, we all have the power to execute
in our relationships, or to pardon. 12:55We never did find out
the identity of our anonymous neighbor. 12:59(Laughter) 13:00But if we did, I'd hope we'd simply say, ""Can we have coffee?"" And maybe there's somebody
you need to have coffee with and find your common ground with them. Or maybe there's somebody
you're in a relationship with and you need to exchange
extravagant grace. Maybe go first. 13:21These two strategies have taught me how to exchange extravagant grace
in my relationships and to enjoy the beautiful design
of my neighbors. I want to continue to choose
relationships over agonism. Will you choose to join me? 13:40Thank you. 13:41(Applause) "
2,What young women believe about their own sexual pleasure,Peggy Orenstein,Mar 2017,"Why do girls feel empowered to engage in sexual activity but not to enjoy it? For three years, author Peggy Orenstein interviewed girls ages 15 to 20 about their attitudes toward and experiences of sex. She discusses the pleasure that's largely missing from their sexual encounters and calls on us to close the ""orgasm gap"" by talking candidly with our girls from an early age about sex, bodies, pleasure and intimacy.", (132K),"Transcript (27 Languages)CatalàEesti keelEnglishEspañolFrançaisItalianoMagyarNederlandsPolskiPortuguês brasileiroPortuguês de PortugalRomânăSlovenščinaTiếng ViệtTürkçeČeštinaРусскийбългарскимакедонскиעבריתالعربيةفارسىภาษาไทย中文 (简体)中文 (繁體)日本語한국어00:00For several years now, we've been engaged in a national debate
about sexual assault on campus. No question -- it's crucial that young people
understand the ground rules for consent, but that's where the conversation
about sex is ending. And in that vacuum of information the media and the Internet -- that new digital street corner -- are educating our kids for us. If we truly want young people
to engage safely, ethically, and yes, enjoyably, it's time to have open honest discussion
about what happens after ""yes,"" and that includes breaking
the biggest taboo of all and talking to young people about women's capacity for
and entitlement to sexual pleasure. Yeah. 00:52(Applause) 00:53Come on, ladies. 00:54(Applause) 00:56I spent three years
talking to girls ages 15 to 20 about their attitudes
and experience of sex. And what I found was that while young women may feel
entitled to engage in sexual behavior, they don't necessarily
feel entitled to enjoy it. Take this sophomore
at the Ivy League college who told me, ""I come from a long line
of smart, strong women. My grandmother was a firecracker, my mom is a professional, my sister and I are loud,
and that's our form of feminine power."" She then proceeded
to describe her sex life to me: a series of one-off hookups, starting when she was 13, that were ... not especially responsible, not especially reciprocal and not especially enjoyable. She shrugged. ""I guess we girls are just socialized
to be these docile creatures who don't express our wants or needs."" ""Wait a minute,"" I replied. ""Didn't you just tell me
what a smart, strong woman you are?"" She hemmed and hawed. ""I guess,"" she finally said, ""no one told me that that smart,
strong image applies to sex."" 02:05I should probably say right up top
that despite the hype, teenagers are not engaging in intercourse
more often or at a younger age than they were 25 years ago. They are, however,
engaging in other behavior. And when we ignore that, when we label that as ""not sex,"" that opens the door
to risky behavior and disrespect. That's particularly true of oral sex, which teenagers consider
to be less intimate than intercourse. Girls would tell me, ""it's no big deal,"" like they'd all read
the same instruction manual -- at least if boys
were on the receiving end. Young women have lots
of reasons for participating. It made them feel desired; it was a way to boost social status. Sometimes, it was a way
to get out of an uncomfortable situation. As a freshman at a West Coast
college said to me, ""A girl will give a guy a blow job
at the end of the night because she doesn't
want to have sex with him, and he expects to be satisfied. So, if I want him to leave and I don't want anything to happen ... "" I heard so many stories
of girls performing one-sided oral sex that I started asking, ""What if every time
you were alone with a guy, he told you to get him
a glass of water from the kitchen, and he never got you a glass of water -- or if he did, it was like ... 'you want me to uh ...?'"" You know, totally begrudging. You wouldn't stand for it. 03:38But it wasn't always
that boys didn't want to. It was that girls didn't want them to. Girls expressed a sense of shame
around their genitals. A sense that they were
simultaneously icky and sacred. Women's feelings about their genitals have been directly linked
to their enjoyment of sex. Yet, Debby Herbenick,
a researcher at Indiana University, believes that girls' genital
self-image is under siege, with more pressure than ever to see them as unacceptable
in their natural state. According to research, about three-quarters of college women
remove their pubic hair -- all of it -- at least on occasion, and more than half do so regularly. Girls would tell me that hair removal
made them feel cleaner, that it was a personal choice. Though, I kind of wondered
if left alone on a desert island, if this was how they would
choose to spend their time. 04:38(Laughter) 04:39And when I pushed further, a darker motivation emerged: avoiding humiliation. ""Guys act like they
would be disgusted by it,"" one young woman told me. ""No one wants to be
talked about like that."" The rising pubic hair removal
reminded me of the 1920s, when women first started regularly
shaving their armpits and their legs. That's when flapper dresses
came into style, and women's limbs were suddenly visible, open to public scrutiny. There's a way that I think
that this too is a sign. That a girl's most intimate part
is open to public scrutiny, open to critique, to becoming more about
how it looks to someone else than how it feels to her. 05:26The shaving trend has sparked
another rise in labiaplasty. Labiaplasty, which is the trimming
of the inner and outer labia, is the fastest-growing cosmetic
surgery among teenage girls. It rose 80 percent between 2014 and 2015, and whereas girls under 18 comprise
two percent of all cosmetic surgeries, they are five percent of labiaplasty. The most sought-after look, incidentally, in which the outer labia
appear fused like a clam shell, is called ... wait for it ... ""The Barbie."" 06:04(Groan) 06:06I trust I don't have to tell you that Barbie is a) made of plastic and b) has no genitalia. 06:14(Laughter) 06:16The labiaplasty trend
has become so worrisome that the American College
of Obstetricians and Gynecologists has issued a statement on the procedure, which is rarely medically indicated, has not been proven safe and whose side effects
include scarring, numbness, pain and diminished sexual sensation. Now, admittedly, and blessedly, the number of girls involved
is still quite small, but you could see them
as canaries in a coal mine, telling us something important
about the way girls see their bodies. 06:53Sara McClelland, a psychologist
at the University of Michigan, coined what is my favorite phrase ever
in talking about all of this: ""Intimate justice."" That's the idea that sex has political,
as well as personal implications, just like, who does
the dishes in your house, or who vacuums the rug. And it raises similar
issues about inequality, about economic disparity, violence, physical and mental health. Intimate justice asks us to consider who is entitled
to engage in an experience. Who is entitled to enjoy it? Who is the primary beneficiary? And how does each partner
define ""good enough""? Honestly, I think those questions
are tricky and sometimes traumatic for adult women to confront, but when we're talking about girls, I just kept coming back to the idea
that their early sexual experience shouldn't have to be
something that they get over. 08:01In her work, McClelland found that young women
were more likely than young men to use their partner's pleasure
as a measure of their satisfaction. So they'd say things like, ""If he's sexually satisfied, then I'm sexually satisfied."" Young men were more likely to measure
their satisfaction by their own orgasm. Young women also defined
bad sex differently. In the largest ever survey ever conducted
on American sexual behavior, they reported pain
in their sexual encounters 30 percent of the time. They also used words like ""depressing,"" ""humiliating,"" ""degrading."" The young men never used that language. So when young women
report sexual satisfaction levels that are equal to
or greater than young men's -- and they do in research -- that can be deceptive. If a girl goes into an encounter
hoping that it won't hurt, wanting to feel close to her partner and expecting him to have an orgasm, she'll be satisfied
if those criteria are met. And there's nothing wrong with wanting
to feel close to your partner, or wanting him to be happy, and orgasm isn't the only
measure of an experience ... but absence of pain -- that's a very low bar
for your own sexual fulfillment. 09:29Listening to all of this
and thinking about it, I began to realize that we performed
a kind of psychological clitoridectomy on American girls. Starting in infancy, parents of baby boys are more likely
to name all their body parts, at least they'll say,
""here's your pee-pee."" Parents of baby girls
go right from navel to knees, and they leave this whole
situation in here unnamed. 09:52(Laughter) 09:54There's no better way
to make something unspeakable than not to name it. Then kids go into
their puberty education classes and they learn that boys
have erections and ejaculations, and girls have ... periods and unwanted pregnancy. And they see that internal diagram
of a woman's reproductive system -- you know, the one that looks
kind of like a steer head -- 10:18(Laughter) 10:22And it always grays out between the legs. So we never say vulva, we certainly never say clitoris. No surprise, fewer than half
of teenage girls age 14 to 17 have ever masturbated. And then they go
into their partnered experience and we expect that somehow
they'll think sex is about them, that they'll be able to articulate
their needs, their desires, their limits. It's unrealistic. 10:52Here's something, though. Girls' investment
in their partner's pleasure remains regardless of the gender of the partner. So in same-sex encounters, the orgasm gap disappears. And young women climax
at the same rate as men. Lesbian and bisexual girls would tell me that they felt liberated
to get off the script -- free to create an encounter
that worked for them. Gay girls also challenged
the idea of first intercourse as the definition of virginity. Not because intercourse isn't a big deal, but it's worth questioning
why we consider this one act, which most girls associate
with discomfort or pain, to be the line in the sand
of sexual adulthood -- so much more meaningful, so much more transformative
than anything else. And it's worth considering
how this is serving girls; whether it's keeping them
safer from disease, coercion, betrayal, assault. Whether it's encouraging
mutuality and caring; what it means about the way
they see other sex acts; whether it's giving them more control over and joy in their experience, and what it means about gay teens, who can have multiple sex partners
without heterosexual intercourse. So I asked a gay girl that I met, ""How'd you know
you weren't a virgin anymore?"" She said she had to Google it. 12:21(Laughter) 12:23And Google wasn't sure. 12:25(Laughter) 12:27She finally decided
that she wasn't a virgin anymore after she'd had
her first orgasm with a partner. And I thought -- whoa. What if just for a second we imagined that was the definition? Again, not because
intercourse isn't a big deal -- of course it is -- but it isn't the only big deal, and rather than thinking about sex
as a race to a goal, this helps us reconceptualize it
as a pool of experiences that include warmth, affection, arousal, desire, touch, intimacy. And it's worth asking young people: who's really the more sexually
experienced person? The one who makes out
with a partner for three hours and experiments with sensual
tension and communication, or the one who gets wasted at a party
and hooks up with a random in order to dump their ""virginity""
before they get to college? 13:29The only way that shift
in thinking can happen though is if we talk to young people
more about sex -- if we normalize those discussions, integrating them into everyday life, talking about those intimate acts
in a different way -- the way we mostly have changed in the way that we talk
about women in the public realm. 13:51Consider a survey
of 300 randomly chosen girls from a Dutch and an American university, two similar universities, talking about their early
experience of sex. The Dutch girls embodied everything
we say we want from our girls. They had fewer negative consequences, like disease, pregnancy, regret -- more positive outcomes like being able to communicate
with their partner, who they said they knew very well; preparing for the experience responsibly; enjoying themselves. What was their secret? The Dutch girls said
that their doctors, teachers and parents talked to them candidly, from an early age, about sex, pleasure
and the importance of mutual trust. What's more, while American parents weren't necessarily
less comfortable talking about sex, we tend to frame those conversations entirely in terms or risk and danger, whereas Dutch parents talk
about balancing responsibility and joy. I have to tell you, as a parent myself, that hit me hard, because I know, had I not delved into that research, I would have talked to my own child
about contraception, about disease protection, about consent because I'm a modern parent, and I would have thought ... job well done. 15:24Now I know that's not enough. I also know what I hope for for our girls. I want them to see sexuality
as a source of self-knowledge, creativity and communication, despite its potential risks. I want them to be able
to revel in their bodies' sensuality without being reduced to it. I want them to be able
to ask for what they want in bed, and to get it. I want them to be safe
from unwanted pregnancy, disease, cruelty, dehumanization, violence. If they are assaulted, I want them to have recourse
from their schools, their employers, the courts. It's a lot to ask, but it's not too much. 16:15As parents, teachers,
advocates and activists, we have raised a generation
of girls to have a voice, to expect egalitarian
treatment in the home, in the classroom, in the workplace. Now it's time to demand
that intimate justice in their personal lives as well. 16:39Thank you. 16:41(Applause) "
2,How compassion could save your strained relationships,Betty Hart,Mar 2021,"When personal relationships and ideological differences collide, the result can lead to strained relations -- or even years of silence and distance. Actor Betty Hart offers an alternative to cold shoulders and haughty hellos: compassion, and a chance for growth and change instead of losing important time with loved ones.", (48K),"Transcript (12 Languages)EnglishEspañolFrançaisPortuguês brasileiroPortuguês de PortugalTiếng ViệtTürkçeالعربية中文 (简体)中文 (繁體)日本語한국어FootnotesFootnotes00:01I am unabashedly a daddy's girl. My daddy is the first person
to have told me that I was beautiful. He often told me that he loved me, and he was one of my favorite
people in the entire world, which was why it was really challenging to discover that we had
a deep ideological divide that was so sincere and so deep that caused me to not talk
to him for 10 years. Before the term was coined, I canceled my father. 00:45In the last few years, cancel culture has of course
come into great prominence. It's existed throughout time, but cancel culture in the bigger society is when a person in prominence
says or does something that we, the people, disagree with, and the decision is made
to make them persona non grata. They are done. They are not to be revered. They are not to be
a part of our world anymore. And that is in the public realm. I'm going to talk to you today
about the private realm. When we choose to cancel
the people in our circle, the people in our core, the people who love us and who we love, and it has been mutually beneficial, but due to a deep
and sincere ideological divide, we make the decision
to cancel them out of our lives. I want to suggest that
cancel culture needs to change, and instead we need to
move to compassion culture. 01:52But before I go there, let me tell you
two of the premises that exist when we indulge in cancel culture. One, we have to believe that we're right. A hundred percent, no possibility of being wrong. And two, the other person, the person we're going to cancel, clearly does not have the ability to change, to grow, to develop. 02:21Obviously, both of these are problematic because sometimes we're not right. I don't know about you,
but there have been times in my life when I knew beyond
a shadow of a doubt that I was right only to discover that I was wrong, badly wrong, completely missed the mark. So if it could happen to me
and perhaps it's happened to you, perhaps it could happen to others. 02:49The second is a little
even more challenging because I know that
I've changed over the years. Haven't we all? Though the core parts of Betty
have pretty much stayed the same, there have been key elements
that have changed drastically. The Betty of eight years old was
not the same as the Betty of 18, which was not the same as 28,
which was not the same as 38. I've changed. And if I'm able to change, shouldn't I extend grace
to believe that others can change too? 03:27So what should we do? Instead of canceling people,
we should use the tool called compassion. I find the definition of compassion
is a fascinating one. And it's not one
that I hear people talk about. Compassion means to suffer with someone. To suffer alongside them. Imagine. When someone, say, Grandpa, says that thing
that's caused you to decide he's no longer invited to Thanksgiving, what if instead we chose
to suffer alongside him? We decided that our love
was so big, so deep, so strong that we were willing to suffer, even when it could be potentially painful. 04:22Now let's be clear. I am not denying anyone's right
to cancel anyone else. What I'm suggesting is that
maybe that's not the best way. When we think about the situation
with Grandpa at Thanksgiving, if we choose to cancel him, we are no longer in proximity to him. Not only do we not get to hear
his point of view, we don't get to share ours. What if we're the only person, because of our deep connection and love
and affection for our grandfather -- and substitute anyone you choose. What if we're the ones
to plant seeds of change, seeds of influence, seeds of difference. Now, to be fair, I cannot promise you
that just because you plant the seed, that it will get water, that it'll get any sunlight
or even a little fertilizer. But what I can tell you
is that if you don't plant it, who will? 05:30I find it interesting, this idea of suffering alongside someone. It means that we are choosing
to value the totality of the person rather than one particular aspect, like a framework or a mindset
or a belief system. We're choosing to believe
that the entire person is more valuable than any of the individual parts. 05:56And I found an amazing duo
who demonstrated this beautifully. Perhaps you've heard of them. The late justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Antonin Scalia were close, close friends. And they were completely divided
in terms of belief systems. In fact, Antonin Scalia once said, ""What's not to like,
other than her thoughts on the law."" He believed she was wrong. She believed he was wrong. They did not shift
in that point of view whatsoever. And yet they had tea together every week, and every New Year's Eve, they spent it together
with their families. They went on family vacations together. They chose to suffer
with each other rather than to cancel each other. Their love and respect for each other continued to grow, even though they never saw eye to eye. 07:07I imagine that curiosity
might be a part of that. That if we choose to be curious
about that which is different, we might discover something along the way. After all, if we are who we are
because of our lived experiences, isn't that true for someone else? And have we ever decided
to use that tool of empathy, of walking a mile or so
in someone else's shoes to really discover the context
for why they believe what they believe? 07:39Now, by now you're probably saying, ""Yeah, OK, Betty, this sounds good. But what about you? What about you and your dad?"" It's a fair question. After 10 years of not talking to my dad, I picked up the phone one day,
called him and said, ""I bet if it were up to you, you'd probably go back in time
and change some things. I know I would. But since we can't, how about we start again?"" And he said, ""Yes, because I love you. I always have. And I always will."" I am so grateful that I made that call because there was no way for me to know that a few years later
my dad would develop Alzheimer's. And a few years after that he would die. And we never saw eye to eye
about the thing that divided us, ever. But our love continued. It continued through those 10 years
when we didn't speak and it continued in the six years after. 09:03So I am encouraging us
to become a society of people that choose compassion over canceling. I'm asking us to consider that curiosity might be a better practice. That we might choose empathy, that we might choose
to have a love that is so deep, so wide, so strong that it can surpass differences. Why are we so scared
of differences anyway? I also want us to be a people
that plant seeds, seeds of change, seeds of influence, seeds of diversity. Again, I cannot promise
to you or anyone else that planting that seed
is going to make a difference. But what if it does? I am the sum of who I am because of everything
that I've been exposed to. My mind has changed over the years and grown because of the people
in my life who planted seeds in me, some that I saw and some that I didn't. So wouldn't it be great if instead of having a cancel culture we create a compassion culture where we are willing to suffer
alongside the ones we love, because we love them. And can't we become
a community that plants seeds? After all, if we don't, who will? 10:47Thank you. "
2,"How to discover your ""why"" in difficult times",Simon Sinek,May 2021,"What has the coronavirus pandemic taught us about ourselves and our relationships? In a deeply personal and wide-ranging conversation, leadership expert Simon Sinek shares his own experience caring for his mental health as the world shut down. He discusses why we need to nurture friendships (in both good times and bad), explains why anyone can be a leader -- and reveals the secret to discovering your ""why"" in life. (This virtual conversation, hosted by head of TED Chris Anderson, ...", (62K),"Transcript (12 Languages)EnglishEspañolFrançaisHrvatskiTiếng ViệtРусскийעבריתالعربيةفارسىภาษาไทย中文 (繁體)한국어00:00Chris Anderson: Simon, I'll start us off
by saying, I mean, here we are, look, after a year of the pandemic, probably one of the most extraordinary
experiences any of us have had. What do you think the unexpected
psychological carryovers might be? I mean, do you think we've kind of -- Part of me thinks that people
have got more fragile, that it's almost like
there's a sort of learned timidity. Have you seen any evidence of that
or how would you characterize it? 00:29Simon Sinek: I think we've definitely
all become much more aware of mental health. And that it's a real thing and that mental health affects
strong and healthy people. We all suffered trauma during COVID. Some of us dealt with it earlier,
some of us dealt with it later, some of us are still dealing with it,
but nobody escapes it. When COVID first started, you know, many of us had to pivot our organizations, had to pivot our businesses very quickly. And so I, like many others,
we went into mission mode. And I called a friend of mine
who is active-duty military. And I asked him a very simple question, how do I compartmentalize my emotions
so that I can stay focused on the mission? And he gave me a very stern warning. He said, you can't. He said, we can compartmentalize our
emotions for only a short period of time, but no one, no one escapes
the trauma of combat. And he said, you may not even experience
the trauma while you're in it, you may not experience it when
you first come home, you may experience it months later. He says, I experience it four
or five months after I get home. So immediately I hung up the phone and called all my A-type
personality friends and said, OK, we think we're good, but we're going to get hit
by this at some point. And we made a deal that when we
started to feel off our game, we would call each other. Safe space. And we made another deal
that there would be no crying alone. That if you had to cry, you picked up
the phone and you called somebody. 01:56Well, about four or five
months into COVID, I started to feel off my game
and I didn't know what was going on. And so I called that same
friend in the military and I asked no leading questions. I simply asked him, tell me what your
symptoms are when you suffer the trauma when you come home from combat. And he said, well, number one,
he falls out of his sleep pattern. He said he starts going to bed
late for no reason and doesn't want to get up in the morning. And I thought to myself, yep. He says he has some unproductive days
and he comes up with an excuse like, ""It's OK, you know,
you deserve a rest. It's fine."" But then he has another
and another and another. And I thought to myself, yep. And he said he becomes very antisocial
where he doesn't want to ask for help and he definitely doesn't want
to talk to anybody. And I thought to myself, yep. And I realized what I was going
through was trauma. And I was afraid to use
the D-word, depression, for fear that that was some
sort of diagnosis. I think a lot of people
are afraid of that word, but that's exactly
what I was going through. I was going through 
lowercase “D” depression. And I followed the rule
that we set with our friends and I called people. Because one of the things
I asked my friend is like, how do you overcome it? He said, you have to force yourself
back into a sleep pattern and force yourself to call friends
and ask for help. 03:13And so I think one of the things, I think that comes out of COVID, is we recognized just the importance
of human connection. You know, in this fast-paced
digital world, we kidded ourselves to think
that we had connections just because we were connected. But it was amazing to see
when COVID started, regardless of someone's age
or a technological competency, we all picked up the phone. Like, young people
were talking to each other. And I think that intense craving
for a human voice and human touch, I think we were reminded just
how fragile we are as human beings. 03:49CA: That phrase you've mentioned,
""no crying alone,"" that's powerful. I mean, forgive me asking,
did you cry with someone? 03:56SS: Yes. I followed my own counsel to my friends. And when I had to cry,
when I was overwhelmed, I picked up the phone and I just cried. And I had friends call me and do the same. 04:12CA: And there was healing in that. 04:14SS: The most important thing
that came from it was that we didn't -- none of us felt alone. And there's intense safety. That amazing sense of safety
that we all desire as human beings. You know, you can't feel safe
when you're vulnerable, like, that's when we need it the most. But you have to build those relationships. You build those relationships
in the happy times, the good times, where you think you're strong,
you think you're great. It’s very hard to start
building those relationships in the moment of crisis. And I think it's a lesson
for leadership, quite frankly. Which is, you can't judge
the quality of a crew by how a ship performs in calm waters. You judge the quality of a crew
by how a ship performs in rough waters. But the time in calm waters is when you're building
relationship and trust and you don't really actually know
if you have trusting relationships and trusting teams
and loving relationships until the crisis strikes. And I heard this from a lot of people: When COVID happened, they commented on how they realized
who their real friends were. Some people kind of fell by the wayside,
it was nothing personal. It's just like, we didn't call each other
and we're still, you know, weren’t angry or anything. And there are some people who came out
of the woodwork to check in on us and those friendships flourished. And that's what I mean. It takes hardship for those friendships
and that trust to really bear fruit. But that's why we have to invest
in people when we're doing well and we don't think we need anybody. And I think we forget that. 05:49CA: What would you say
to someone who has realized that they're in this moment,
what's been a really difficult year, and they actually don't feel
that there's someone they could, for example, pick up the phone and cry with? Is it hopeless for them until this passes? Or what would you say to them? 06:09SS: There is an irony. There's an irony in when we need help. And when I was writing
the book ""Leaders Eat Last,"" I had the opportunity
to spend some time with and visit Alcoholics Anonymous. And it is a remarkable organization. And many of us are familiar
with the 12-step program. And many of us are familiar
with the first step, which is admitting you have a problem. But then it's the other 11 steps
that also matter. And Alcoholics Anonymous knows that if you master the first 11 steps, but not the 12th, you are likely to succumb to the disease. But if you master the 12 steps, you're more likely
to overcome the disease. That 12th step is to help
another alcoholic. It's service. And so there's a great irony
when we need help to actually help someone who's struggling
with the same thing as us. And it is the most
healing thing we can do. So, you know, if we need
someone to cry with, it's to offer the shoulder
for somebody else to cry with. If we're feeling lonely, it's to be there for someone else
who's struggling with loneliness. And this goes way beyond these subjects, which is if we're looking for love
to help somebody else find love, if we're looking for the job we love, to help somebody else
find the job that they love. And there's tremendous value in service. 07:26And you hear about these
things all the time, you talk to people why they chose to go
in the profession they went into, especially if they're in
the service profession, let's say somebody
is a counselor for trauma. And you say, why did you go
into this profession? ""When I was younger,
I suffered a trauma, and somebody was there to counsel me and I decided I wanted to commit
my life to doing that for others."" This is what happens with service. And we forget, just because we live
in a modern world, we're actually a very
old-fashioned machine. The human animal is a legacy machine
living in a modern world. And we still work the same way we used to. And we desperately need each other
to survive and thrive as much as we did
when we were living in huts in small tribes of 150 people. And so service service is the thing. 08:12CA: That sounds like, even for someone who's not feeling,
like, depressed or at the edge right now, but a good checklist-question to ask is, is there someone
I could reach out to actually, there maybe other people
who are in a much worse situation and maybe there is a call I could make that would be incredibly
valuable to that person and help build
a relationship with future? 08:30SS: ""Are you OK?"" ""How are you? You know, a friend of mine, George Flynn, he says his test for a leader is
if they ask you how you're doing, they actually care about the answer. And I really like that. 08:46CA: OK, I could talk with you
for hours about this, but we're going to go
to some questions now. So here's a question from Kayum. ""If there is no way to get back
to normal,"" as you said, ""then are we on the right path
of building new normal already? Or can you help us with a blueprint
that new normal should be based on?"" 09:04SS: So blueprint? No. Guidances? Yes. I think that humanity has to be -- We have to remember that humanity matters. And when I say humanity,
I don't mean big-H Humanity, I mean little-H humanity, our humanity. When COVID first happened, so many leaders leaned on their humanity, whether they were effective
or ineffective leaders prior to COVID, many of them picked up the phone
and said, ""Are you OK?"" They called their teams
just to check in on them. Or they called their friends to say,
""Are you OK? How are you?"" Well, we don't need a global
pandemic to do that. That's called good leadership and we should be doing that all the time. And we should be encouraging
those in our charge to do the same for those in their charge. You know, the hierarchy
can still be effective that way. I hope that remains. I hope that remains. I hope the use of the telephone remains. That we don't just go back
to texting all the time. I hope that putting our phones away
and having family dinner remains. I think there's a lot of kids that will actually come through this with stronger relationships
with their siblings if they have them, and stronger relationship
with their parents because they had so much time together. And kids who may have struggled prior because they weren't getting
the kind of attention they needed because their parents
were so busy with work, you know, even if mom or dad
are busy on a Zoom call all day, that hour that they would ordinarily
just go get a cup of coffee or something, that they could focus on their kid. I think a lot of kids
actually will come out of this. And kids are remarkably adaptable. They're remarkably adaptable. 10:47CA: Here’s a question from Mariusz. ""Could you give us some tips
on how to discover our Why?"" 10:54SS: Absolutely. I'll give you a little exercise
that you can do with your friends. It's called the Friends Exercise. Find a friend you love and who loves you. The person who, if they called you
at three o'clock in the morning, you take the call and you know
they would do the same for you. Do not do this with a sibling or a spouse. Do not do this with a parent. Those relationships are too close. Do it with a best friend. And go up to them
and ask the simple question, ""Why are we friends?"" And they're going to look at you
like you're crazy because you're asking them
to put into words a feeling. You're asking them to use
a part of the brain, the neocortex, that doesn't control feelings, and to put the thing that exists
in the limbic brain into language, which it doesn't do. And so it's actually
a very difficult question. They're going to say, ""I don't know."" It's not that they don't know,
it's that they can't put it into words. Ironically, you stop asking
the question why and you start asking the question, ""what""
because ""what"" is a rational question. ""What is it about me that I know
that you would be there for me no matter what?"" And they won't know how to answer it. They'll start describing you. ""I don't know, you're funny, I trust you. You've always been there for me."" You play devil's advocate. ""Good. That's the definition of a friend. What specifically is it about me that I know you'd be there for me
no matter what?"" And they'll continue to do the same. They'll keep trying to describe you.
You keep playing devil's advocate. You get the idea. Eventually they'll give up
and they'll start describing themselves. And they'll say, and this is what my friend said to me
when I did it with them, ""I don't know, Simon.
I don't even have to talk to you. I could just sit in the same room as you
and I feel inspired."" And I got goosebumps,
I'm getting them right now. They will articulate the value
you have in their life and you will have some sort
of emotional response, goosebumps or you'll well up, because what they're telling you
is your Why, your Why is the thing
you give to the world. You can do this with multiple friends
and they will say almost exactly, if not the exact same thing,
because that is your Why. That is the thing you give to the world. So it may not give you exact language, but it will put you squarely
in the ballpark for what your Why is. 12:54CA: Here's an anonymous question. ""I have a friend who is currently
struggling with depression, and he's just not like he used to be. I don't know what to say to him. He's actually annoyed by the question,
'How are you doing?' How can I offer my help?"" 13:09SS: So one of the things I learned
by accident a couple of years ago is sometimes statements
work better than questions. Because questions people can avoid, right? This is what we all did during COVID. ""How are you?"" ""Fine. Fine.""
Everyone's fine, right? And then what do you do with that? And so try making a statement, right? Something's wrong. Something's different. You're not the same. I'm worried about you. Make statements. And it leaves very little room for somebody to divert the conversation. You're not the person I know. And do it with love and empathy
and the most important thing, don't show up to solve the problem. Especially when you're starting
to have a difficult conversation, you don't show up to solve the problem. You show up to create an environment in which they'd be willing
to open up to you. That's the only goal. So try a statement instead of a question. 14:15CA: So here's the last question,
I'm going to ask this for me. What do you mean, Simon,
when you say that everyone is a leader? 14:25SS: Leadership has nothing
to do with rank or title. I know many people who sit
at the highest levels of organizations who are not leaders. We do as they tell us
because they have authority over us, but we don't trust them
and we wouldn't follow them. And yet I also know many people who sit
at very low levels of organizations that have no formal rank
and no formal authority, and yet they've made the choice to look after the person
to the left of them and the person to the right of them, and we would trust them
and follow them anywhere. Leadership is the responsibility
to see those around us rise. It's the responsibility to take care
of those around us. That's what leadership is. It's not about being in charge. It's about taking care
of those in our charge. And the only thing title
and authority allow you to do is lead with greater scale. Every single one of us has the opportunity
to be the leader we wish we had. Every single one of us. 15:13CA: Simon, thank you so much
for spending this time with us. 15:16SS: Thanks, Chris. I really appreciate it. Take care of yourself.
Take care of each other. 15:20[Get access to thought-provoking

2,This could be why you're depressed or anxious,Johann Hari,Sep 2019,"In a moving talk, journalist Johann Hari shares fresh insights on the causes of depression and anxiety from experts around the world -- as well as some exciting emerging solutions. ""If you're depressed or anxious, you're not weak and you're not crazy -- you're a human being with unmet needs,"" Hari says.", (484K),"Transcript (29 Languages)Bahasa IndonesiaDeutschEnglishEspañolFrançaisHrvatskiItalianoLatviešuMagyarPolskiPortuguês brasileiroPortuguês de PortugalRomânăTiếng ViệtTürkçeРусскийСрпски, Srpskiбългарскиעבריתالعربيةفارسىکوردی سۆرانیکورمانجیमराठीहिन्दीગુજરાતી中文 (简体)中文 (繁體)한국어FootnotesFootnotes00:01footnotefootnoteFor a really long time, I had two mysteries
that were hanging over me. I didn't understand them and, to be honest, I was quite afraid
to look into them. The first mystery was, I'm 40 years old, and all throughout my lifetime,
year after year, serious depression and anxiety have risen, in the United States, in Britain, and across the Western world. And I wanted to understand why. Why is this happening to us? Why is it that with each year that passes, more and more of us are finding it harder
to get through the day? And I wanted to understand this
because of a more personal mystery. 00:43When I was a teenager, I remember going to my doctor and explaining that I had this feeling,
like pain was leaking out of me. I couldn't control it, I didn't understand why it was happening, I felt quite ashamed of it. And my doctor told me a story that I now realize was well-intentioned, but quite oversimplified. Not totally wrong. My doctor said, ""We know
why people get like this. Some people just naturally get
a chemical imbalance in their heads -- you're clearly one of them. All we need to do is give you some drugs, it will get your chemical
balance back to normal."" 01:16footnotefootnoteSo I started taking a drug
called Paxil or Seroxat, it's the same thing with different names
in different countries. And I felt much better,
I got a real boost. But not very long afterwards, this feeling of pain started to come back. So I was given higher and higher doses until, for 13 years, I was taking
the maximum possible dose that you're legally allowed to take. And for a lot of those 13 years,
and pretty much all the time by the end, I was still in a lot of pain. And I started asking myself,
""What's going on here? Because you're doing everything you're told to do by the story
that's dominating the culture -- why do you still feel like this?"" 01:50So to get to the bottom
of these two mysteries, for a book that I've written I ended up going on a big journey
all over the world, I traveled over 40,000 miles. I wanted to sit with the leading
experts in the world about what causes depression and anxiety and crucially, what solves them, and people who have come through
depression and anxiety and out the other side
in all sorts of ways. And I learned a huge amount from the amazing people
I got to know along the way. 02:14footnotefootnoteBut I think at the heart
of what I learned is, so far, we have scientific evidence for nine different causes
of depression and anxiety. Two of them are indeed in our biology. Your genes can make you
more sensitive to these problems, though they don't write your destiny. And there are real brain changes
that can happen when you become depressed that can make it harder to get out. But most of the factors
that have been proven to cause depression and anxiety are not in our biology. They are factors in the way we live. And once you understand them, it opens up a very different
set of solutions that should be offered to people alongside the option
of chemical antidepressants. 02:55For example, if you're lonely, you're more likely
to become depressed. If, when you go to work,
you don't have any control over your job, you've just got to do what you're told, you're more likely to become depressed. If you very rarely get out
into the natural world, you're more likely to become depressed. 03:11And one thing unites a lot of the causes
of depression and anxiety that I learned about. Not all of them, but a lot of them. Everyone here knows you've all got natural
physical needs, right? Obviously. You need food, you need water, you need shelter, you need clean air. If I took those things away from you, you'd all be in real trouble, real fast. But at the same time, every human being
has natural psychological needs. You need to feel you belong. You need to feel your life
has meaning and purpose. You need to feel that people
see you and value you. You need to feel you've got
a future that makes sense. And this culture we built
is good at lots of things. And many things are better
than in the past -- I'm glad to be alive today. But we've been getting less and less good at meeting these deep,
underlying psychological needs. And it's not the only thing
that's going on, but I think it's the key reason
why this crisis keeps rising and rising. And I found this really hard to absorb. I really wrestled with the idea of shifting from thinking of my depression
as just a problem in my brain, to one with many causes, including many in the way we're living. 04:22footnotefootnoteAnd it only really began
to fall into place for me when one day, I went to interview
a South African psychiatrist named Dr. Derek Summerfield. He's a great guy. And Dr. Summerfield
happened to be in Cambodia in 2001, when they first introduced
chemical antidepressants for people in that country. And the local doctors, the Cambodians,
had never heard of these drugs, so they were like, what are they? And he explained. And they said to him, ""We don't need them,
we've already got antidepressants."" And he was like, ""What do you mean?"" He thought they were going to talk about
some kind of herbal remedy, like St. John's Wort, ginkgo biloba,
something like that. Instead, they told him a story. 05:02There was a farmer in their community
who worked in the rice fields. And one day, he stood on a land mine left over from the war
with the United States, and he got his leg blown off. So they him an artificial leg, and after a while, he went back
to work in the rice fields. But apparently, it's super painful
to work under water when you've got an artificial limb, and I'm guessing it was pretty traumatic to go back and work in the field
where he got blown up. The guy started to cry all day, he refused to get out of bed, he developed all the symptoms
of classic depression. The Cambodian doctor said, ""This is when we gave him
an antidepressant."" And Dr. Summerfield said,
""What was it?"" They explained that they went
and sat with him. They listened to him. They realized that his pain made sense -- it was hard for him to see it
in the throes of his depression, but actually, it had perfectly
understandable causes in his life. One of the doctors, talking to the people
in the community, figured, ""You know, if we bought this guy a cow, he could become a dairy farmer, he wouldn't be in this position
that was screwing him up so much, he wouldn't have to go
and work in the rice fields."" So they bought him a cow. Within a couple of weeks,
his crying stopped, within a month, his depression was gone. They said to doctor Summerfield, ""So you see, doctor, that cow,
that was an antidepressant, that's what you mean, right?"" 06:18(Laughter) 06:19(Applause) 06:22footnotefootnoteIf you'd been raised to think
about depression the way I was, and most of the people here were, that sounds like a bad joke, right? ""I went to my doctor
for an antidepressant, she gave me a cow."" But what those Cambodian
doctors knew intuitively, based on this individual,
unscientific anecdote, is what the leading
medical body in the world, the World Health Organization, has been trying to tell us for years, based on the best scientific evidence. 06:48If you're depressed, if you're anxious, you're not weak, you're not crazy, you're not, in the main,
a machine with broken parts. You're a human being with unmet needs. And it's just as important to think here
about what those Cambodian doctors and the World Health Organization
are not saying. They did not say to this farmer, ""Hey, buddy, you need
to pull yourself together. It's your job to figure out
and fix this problem on your own."" On the contrary, what they said is, ""We're here as a group
to pull together with you, so together, we can figure out
and fix this problem."" This is what every depressed person needs, and it's what every
depressed person deserves. 07:35footnotefootnoteThis is why one of the leading
doctors at the United Nations, in their official statement
for World Health Day, couple of years back in 2017, said we need to talk less
about chemical imbalances and more about the imbalances
in the way we live. Drugs give real relief to some people -- they gave relief to me for a while -- but precisely because this problem
goes deeper than their biology, the solutions need to go much deeper, too. 08:00But when I first learned that, I remember thinking, ""OK, I could see
all the scientific evidence, I read a huge number of studies, I interviewed a huge number of the experts
who were explaining this,"" but I kept thinking, ""How can we
possibly do that?"" The things that are making us depressed are in most cases more complex
than what was going on with this Cambodian farmer. Where do we even begin with that insight? 08:22But then, in the long journey for my book, all over the world, I kept meeting people
who were doing exactly that, from Sydney, to San Francisco, to São Paulo. I kept meeting people
who were understanding the deeper causes
of depression and anxiety and, as groups, fixing them. Obviously, I can't tell you
about all the amazing people I got to know and wrote about, or all of the nine causes of depression
and anxiety that I learned about, because they won't let me give
a 10-hour TED Talk -- you can complain about that to them. 08:52footnotefootnoteBut I want to focus on two of the causes and two of the solutions
that emerge from them, if that's alright. Here's the first. We are the loneliest society
in human history. There was a recent study
that asked Americans, ""Do you feel like you're no longer
close to anyone?"" And 39 percent of people
said that described them. ""No longer close to anyone."" In the international
measurements of loneliness, Britain and the rest of Europe
are just behind the US, in case anyone here is feeling smug. 09:21(Laughter) 09:22footnotefootnoteI spent a lot of time discussing this with the leading expert
in the world on loneliness, an incredible man
named professor John Cacioppo, who was at Chicago, and I thought a lot about one question
his work poses to us. Professor Cacioppo asked, ""Why do we exist? Why are we here, why are we alive?"" One key reason is that our ancestors
on the savannas of Africa were really good at one thing. They weren't bigger than the animals
they took down a lot of the time, they weren't faster than the animals
they took down a lot of the time, but they were much better
at banding together into groups and cooperating. This was our superpower as a species -- we band together, just like bees evolved to live in a hive, humans evolved to live in a tribe. And we are the first humans ever to disband our tribes. And it is making us feel awful. But it doesn't have to be this way. 10:17One of the heroes in my book,
and in fact, in my life, is a doctor named Sam Everington. He's a general practitioner
in a poor part of East London, where I lived for many years. And Sam was really uncomfortable, because he had loads of patients coming to him with terrible
depression and anxiety. And like me, he's not opposed
to chemical antidepressants, he thinks they give
some relief to some people. But he could see two things. Firstly, his patients were depressed
and anxious a lot of the time for totally understandable
reasons, like loneliness. And secondly, although the drugs
were giving some relief to some people, for many people,
they didn't solve the problem. The underlying problem. One day, Sam decided
to pioneer a different approach. A woman came to his center,
his medical center, called Lisa Cunningham. I got to know Lisa later. And Lisa had been shut away in her home
with crippling depression and anxiety for seven years. And when she came to Sam's center,
she was told, ""Don't worry, we'll carry on giving you these drugs, but we're also going to prescribe
something else. We're going to prescribe for you
to come here to this center twice a week to meet with a group of other
depressed and anxious people, not to talk about how miserable you are, but to figure out something
meaningful you can all do together so you won't be lonely and you won't feel
like life is pointless."" 11:32The first time this group met, Lisa literally started
vomiting with anxiety, it was so overwhelming for her. But people rubbed her back,
the group started talking, they were like, ""What could we do?"" These are inner-city,
East London people like me, they didn't know anything about gardening. They were like, ""Why don't we
learn gardening?"" There was an area
behind the doctors' offices that was just scrubland. ""Why don't we make this into a garden?"" They started to take books
out of the library, started to watch YouTube clips. They started to get
their fingers in the soil. They started to learn
the rhythms of the seasons. There's a lot of evidence that exposure to the natural world is a really powerful antidepressant. But they started to do something
even more important. They started to form a tribe. They started to form a group. They started to care about each other. If one of them didn't show up, the others would go
looking for them -- ""Are you OK?"" Help them figure out
what was troubling them that day. The way Lisa put it to me, ""As the garden began to bloom, we began to bloom."" 12:32footnotefootnoteThis approach is called
social prescribing, it's spreading all over Europe. And there's a small,
but growing body of evidence suggesting it can produce real
and meaningful falls in depression and anxiety. 12:43And one day, I remember
standing in the garden that Lisa and her once-depressed
friends had built -- it's a really beautiful garden -- and having this thought, it's very much inspired by a guy
called professor Hugh Mackay in Australia. I was thinking, so often
when people feel down in this culture, what we say to them -- I'm sure
everyone here said it, I have -- we say, ""You just need
to be you, be yourself."" And I've realized, actually,
what we should say to people is, ""Don't be you. Don't be yourself. Be us, be we. Be part of a group."" 13:18(Applause) 13:21The solution to these problems does not lie in drawing
more and more on your resources as an isolated individual -- that's partly what got us in this crisis. It lies on reconnecting
with something bigger than you. 13:33And that really connects
to one of the other causes of depression and anxiety
that I wanted to talk to you about. So everyone knows junk food has taken over our diets
and made us physically sick. I don't say that
with any sense of superiority, I literally came to give
this talk from McDonald's. I saw all of you eating that
healthy TED breakfast, I was like no way. But just like junk food has taken over
our diets and made us physically sick, a kind of junk values
have taken over our minds and made us mentally sick. For thousands of years,
philosophers have said, if you think life is about money,
and status and showing off, you're going to feel like crap. That's not an exact quote
from Schopenhauer, but that is the gist of what he said. 14:17footnotefootnoteBut weirdly, hardy anyone
had scientifically investigated this, until a truly extraordinary person
I got to know, named professor Tim Kasser, who's at Knox College in Illinois, and he's been researching this
for about 30 years now. And his research suggests
several really important things. Firstly, the more you believe you can buy and display
your way out of sadness, and into a good life, the more likely you are to become
depressed and anxious. And secondly, as a society, we have become
much more driven by these beliefs. All throughout my lifetime, under the weight of advertising
and Instagram and everything like them. 14:56And as I thought about this, I realized it's like we've all been fed
since birth, a kind of KFC for the soul. We've been trained to look for happiness
in all the wrong places, and just like junk food
doesn't meet your nutritional needs and actually makes you feel terrible, junk values don't meet
your psychological needs, and they take you away from a good life. But when I first spent time
with professor Kasser and I was learning all this, I felt a really weird mixture of emotions. Because on the one hand,
I found this really challenging. I could see how often
in my own life, when I felt down, I tried to remedy it with some kind of
show-offy, grand external solution. And I could see why that
did not work well for me. I also thought,
isn't this kind of obvious? Isn't this almost like banal, right? If I said to everyone here, none of you are going to lie
on your deathbed and think about all the shoes you bought
and all the retweets you got, you're going to think about moments of love, meaning
and connection in your life. I think that seems almost like a cliché. But I kept talking
to professor Kasser and saying, ""Why am I feeling
this strange doubleness?"" And he said, ""At some level,
we all know these things. But in this culture,
we don't live by them."" We know them so well
they've become clichés, but we don't live by them. I kept asking why, why would we know
something so profound, but not live by it? And after a while,
professor Kasser said to me, ""Because we live in a machine that is designed to get us to neglect
what is important about life."" I had to really think about that. ""Because we live in a machine that is designed to get us
to neglect what is important about life."" 16:34footnotefootnoteAnd professor Kasser wanted to figure out
if we can disrupt that machine. He's done loads of research into this; I'll tell you about one example, and I really urge everyone here
to try this with their friends and family. With a guy called Nathan Dungan,
he got a group of teenagers and adults to come together for a series of sessions
over a period of time, to meet up. And part of the point of the group was to get people to think
about a moment in their life they had actually found
meaning and purpose. For different people,
it was different things. For some people, it was playing music,
writing, helping someone -- I'm sure everyone here
can picture something, right? And part of the point of the group
was to get people to ask, ""OK, how could you dedicate
more of your life to pursuing these moments
of meaning and purpose, and less to, I don't know,
buying crap you don't need, putting it on social media
and trying to get people to go, 'OMG, so jealous!'"" 17:24footnotefootnoteAnd what they found was, just having these meetings, it was like a kind of Alcoholics Anonymous
for consumerism, right? Getting people to have these meetings,
articulate these values, determine to act on them
and check in with each other, led to a marked shift in people's values. It took them away from this hurricane
of depression-generating messages training us to seek happiness
in the wrong places, and towards more meaningful
and nourishing values that lift us out of depression. 17:53But with all the solutions that I saw
and have written about, and many I can't talk about here, I kept thinking, you know: Why did it take me so long
to see these insights? Because when you explain them to people -- some of them are more
complicated, but not all -- when you explain this to people,
it's not like rocket science, right? At some level, we already
know these things. Why do we find it so hard to understand? I think there's many reasons. But I think one reason is
that we have to change our understanding of what depression
and anxiety actually are. There are very real
biological contributions to depression and anxiety. But if we allow the biology
to become the whole picture, as I did for so long, as I would argue our culture
has done pretty much most of my life, what we're implicitly saying to people
is, and this isn't anyone's intention, but what we're implicitly
saying to people is, ""Your pain doesn't mean anything. It's just a malfunction. It's like a glitch in a computer program, it's just a wiring problem in your head."" But I was only able to start
changing my life when I realized your depression
is not a malfunction. It's a signal. Your depression is a signal. It's telling you something. 19:12(Applause) 19:17We feel this way for reasons, and they can be hard to see
in the throes of depression -- I understand that really well
from personal experience. But with the right help,
we can understand these problems and we can fix these problems together. But to do that, the very first step is we have to stop insulting these signals by saying they're a sign of weakness,
or madness or purely biological, except for a tiny number of people. We need to start
listening to these signals, because they're telling us
something we really need to hear. It's only when we truly
listen to these signals, and we honor these signals
and respect these signals, that we're going to begin to see the liberating, nourishing,
deeper solutions. The cows that are waiting all around us. 20:11Thank you. 20:12(Applause) "
2,Ethical dilemma: Who should you believe?,Alex Worsnip,Apr 2022,"You're sitting on the couch, when you hear a knock on the door. The police have arrived to arrest your spouse— for murder.

when you hear a knock on the door. The police have just arrived 
to arrest your spouse— for murder. This accusation comes as a total shock. In your experience, your partner has
always been gentle and loving, and you can't imagine them committing
a grisly murder. But the evidence is serious: their fingerprints were found
on the murder weapon. Your spouse insists they're innocent. “I know it looks bad,” they say,
“but you have to believe me! If you don’t, who will?” Should you believe your spouse, even though the evidence 
against them looks damning? Take a second to think what you would
believe in this situation. 00:46This dilemma is part of what philosophers
call the ethics of belief: a field of study that explores 
how we ought to form beliefs, and whether we have ethical duties
to believe certain things. The question here isn't about
what you should do, such as whether or not you should find
your spouse guilty in a court of law. After all, you wouldn’t be on the jury
in their trial! Rather, it’s about what you should believe
to be true. So, what factors should you consider? 01:16Perhaps the most obvious is your evidence. After all, to believe something
is to take it to be true. And evidence is, by definition, all information that helps
us determine what's true. From this, some philosophers draw
the conclusion that evidence is the only thing that ought 
to determine what you believe. This view is called evidentialism,
and a strict evidentialist would say it doesn’t matter that the accused 
is your spouse. You should evaluate the evidence 
from a neutral, objective point of view. Taking the perspective 
of an unbiased third party, your judgment of your spouse's character
is a relevant consideration. But finding their fingerprints 
at the crime scene is surely stronger evidence. So, from an evidentialist point of view, you should either believe 
your spouse is guilty, or at best remain undecided. 02:09Some philosophers present
evidentialism only as a view of what’s most rational to believe. But others, like 19th century 
evidentialist W.K. Clifford, think that following the evidence
is also morally required. One argument for this view is that 
having well-informed, accurate beliefs is often vitally important to determining 
the ethical way to act. Another argument is that there’s something
unethical about being dishonest, and refusing to follow the evidence is 
a way of being dishonest with oneself. 02:45However, perhaps there are other
ethical factors in play. Although the evidence against
your spouse is strong, there’s still a chance that
they’re actually innocent. Think for a moment about how 
it would feel to be innocent, and have no one believe you—
not even your own partner! By not trusting your spouse, you run the risk of seriously hurting
them in their crucial hour of need. Moreover, consider what this lack 
of trust would do to your marriage. It would be incredibly difficult 
to continue a loving relationship with someone that you believed—
or even strongly suspected— was a murderer. You might try to pretend to believe
that your spouse is innocent, but could you really 
go on living that lie? 03:29According to a theory of the ethics 
of belief called pragmatism, these kinds of practical considerations
can sometimes make it right to believe something
even without strong evidence. Some pragmatists would even say 
that you morally owe it to your spouse to believe them. 03:47But is it even possible to believe
your spouse is innocent just because you think it’ll be good
for your relationship? Or because you think you owe
it to the accused? You might desperately want 
to believe they’re innocent, but can you control your beliefs in the
same way you control your actions? It seems like you can’t just believe
whatever you like when the truth is staring you in the face. But on the other hand, 
recall your spouse’s plea. When we say things like this, we seem to be assuming that it is possible
to control our beliefs in some way. So what do you think? 
Can you control what beliefs you have? And if so, what will you believe
about your spouse? "

Would the owners help the visitors — or spurn them? Iseult Gillespie shares the myth of Baucis and Philemon.

shrouded figures appeared in the hillside village. The strangers knocked on every door 
in town, asking for food and shelter. But, again and again, 
they were turned away. Soon, there was just one door left: that of a small, thatched shack. 00:34An elderly couple, Baucis and Philemon,
answered the thunderous knock. Although there was something
off about these visitors, it was in the pair’s nature
to care for those in need. Philemon invited them to rest, and the cottage flooded with warmth
as Baucis teased the fire back to life. 00:59When they were young, Baucis and Philemon
had fallen in love, married, 
and settled in the humble cottage. Decades later, their home
was still standing— and they were more devoted
to each other than ever. 01:17The strangers watched intently as Baucis
nestled twigs under a battered pot filled with vegetables. The couple could rarely afford meat,
but in honor of their guests, Philemon cut strips from an aging shank
for the stew. They made cheerful conversation 
and offered their visitors hot baths. Baucis used a chip of broken clay 
to balance the wobbly table’s legs and rubbed its surface with mint 
until it smelled sweet and fresh. Weaving around each other with care, the couple transformed 
what they had into a feast. Soon, the tabletop overflowed with food
and the last of their sweet wine. 02:05Privately, Baucis and Philemon worried 
that their provisions would run out. Yet, as the night wore on, and their strange guests 
took hearty gulps of wine, the clay vessel never ran dry. The couple, at first relieved, 
grew terrified. Their guests weren’t humble peasants
traveling the countryside. They were almost certainly gods 
in disguise— but which gods, 
they didn’t know. 02:41Panicked that their preparations
were inadequate, Baucis and Philemon searched 
for another offering. The only precious thing left was 
the goose that guarded their home. The couple repeatedly lunged
after the bird, but they were too worn out for the chase. So, they prepared to receive
the wrath of the gods. 03:03Their guests rose up, 
shedding their rags and mortal masks. Looming before them was Zeus, 
the storm-brewing ruler of the gods, and his son, Hermes, the fleet-footed messenger
who shepherded mortals to the underworld. The gods told the old couple that, 
unlike the other townspeople, they had shown true xenia, 
or loving hospitality to strangers. They alone had passed the test. 03:38The gods commanded the couple
to follow them, and the group ascended
the nearest mountain. Nearing the summit, 
Baucis and Philemon looked back— but were shocked to see a murky swamp
where their village stood just moments before. As punishment for refusing
to shelter the gods, Zeus and Hermes had cast 
the townspeople underwater, leaving only their hosts’ home intact, Recalling their friends and neighbors, Baucis and Philemon couldn’t hide
their terror and mournful tears, even as their house transformed below. It grew larger and sprouted
marble pillars and steps. Legends etched themselves
onto its grand doors. Their rickety cottage had metamorphosed
into a gleaming temple for the gods. 04:36Hermes commended the couple and gently
asked if there was anything they desired. After a brief discussion, Philemon
requested that he and Baucis be permitted to care for the new temple. And he asked if, when their time came, 
they could die together, so neither would have to face life
without the other. 04:59Tending to the temple and one another, 
they lived many more years. Until, one day, Baucis noticed leaves
fluttering from her husband’s hands and looked down to find 
her own skin hardening. They embraced, becoming rooted in place. Vines wound around their legs 
and canopies flourished overhead. They bid each other a loving,
last farewell as humans. And where Baucis and Philemon 
had just stood, bent with age, there towered a linden and an oak tree, their branches intertwined for eternity. "
2,Why art is a tool for hope, JR,Jun 2022,"Famed for enormous black-and-white portraits that are pasted on surfaces ranging from the Louvre to the US-Mexico border wall, multimedia artist JR continues to tackle ambitious projects. In this powerfully moving talk, he shares how he made a giant mural on the courtyard floor of a maximum-security prison -- with the help of guards and prisoners alike -- and ended up with much more than a compelling image.", (11K),"Transcript (10 Languages)EnglishEspañolFrançaisPortuguês de PortugalTiếng ViệtTürkçeСрпски, Srpskiالعربية中文 (简体)한국어FootnotesFootnotes00:00Wow, wow, people. You know, actually, I love people
because my work is about people. It's actually about bringing
people together. I'm an artist. I mean, until I found a real job, but now it looks
like it's getting pretty serious. 00:16(Laughter) 00:18But, you know, I also love walls. And I know that walls
are supposed to divide us, but I think I've found a way to use walls to bring us together. And I've tried this in different places. This was in Israel,
Palestine, 15 years ago, where, with my friend Marco, I took photos of Israeli
and Palestinian doing the same job and then pasted them
on Israeli city and Palestinian city, and people couldn't even
recognize who is who. This was in the favelas of Brazil. Faces of women on the hills
of the community. 00:48(Applause) 00:50Often the first target of the violence
that is happening there. This is a local museum we have in Paris,
it's called the Louvre. I don’t know if you’ve heard about it,
but I thought I’d give it a shout out. And with 400 people and paper and glue, we wheat-pasted the entire plazas to make
the pyramid ten times bigger. This was at the border
between Mexico and US. Thank you. 01:15(Applause and cheers) 01:18Kikito, the little kid, is one year old, and he lives in the little house you see
on the top left of the image. I just wonder, at his age,
what is his perspective on the wall? 01:30You know, each time I do a project,
I wonder: Can art change the world? And I never really know
how a projects starts. Couple years ago, I was making breakfast and a friend of mine called me. 01:42Friend Saul, he says, ""JR, you love walls. Why don't you do a project in prison?"" 01:48I was like, you know, I was just,
""Dude, you know, I would do it, but it's too much paperwork
administrative, bureaucracy. Plus, I've been arrested 15 times,
they don't want me in there."" 01:58footnotefootnoteAnd he was like, ""I know, bro, but you love walls so much,
what you would do in there. If you could do it, what could you do?"" 02:05I was like, ""OK, you know what?"" I had an idea. If I wanted to finish my poached eggs and my, you know, French toast
before it gets cold, I had to get rid of him. So I told him, ""You know what,
I'll paste the entire prison."" 02:19He was like, ""Wow, that's amazing."" He hung up the phone, I thought I'd never hear
from him for two decades. 02:25He called his friend Scott,
who was like, ""What's up?"" 02:27Saul is like, “I spoke to JR,
he’s down to do a project in prison.” 02:30Scott's like, ""That's amazing,
let me call the governor."" Hung up the phone, called the governor. 02:35Governor was like, ""Who's this JR?"" 02:37""He does black and white, and, you know, he takes photos of people,
he records their story ..."" 02:43""I'm sorry, I've never heard of it."" 02:44""Yes, there's very large murals."" 02:46footnotefootnoteAnd the governor was like,
""Wait, wait, wait. Before I was the governor,
I was in a mural. There were 1,300 people, each one of them recorded
their story, and I was one of them. Is that the same artist?"" 02:59The guy said, ""Yes,
that's the same artist."" 03:02""Give him full clearance for every prison
in the state of California."" 03:05(Laughter and applause) 03:06Calls me back. Next thing you know, I’m on Google Earth, and there's 35 prisons. I'm looking at them and I'm like,
well, first of all, I'm a wallpaper man. I cannot paste if I don't have
my clear surface. So that doesn't work,
that doesn't work, that doesn't work. The yard is made of sand and grass. I cannot do it. I know nothing about prisons. So then I see this one and I'm like,
""Wait, can we zoom in this one?"" I'm like, ""Oh, actually, you know what? The yard here in the center
looks like it's concrete. I could work on that."" 03:35""Look, JR, that's a supermax
security prison."" It's called Tehachapi, it's actually in the top five
of the most violent prisons. 03:43I was like, ""That will do it."" 03:44The next day, we flew there. We arrived there, and of course, you know,
it's not that easy to get there. It's like fences, electric fences, walls. And you add more walls
and more people that check your IDs. I get all the way to the yard. And it looked like some army guy
with bulletproof jackets and heavily armed who say, ""Alright, this is going
to be very simple. There's some people
waiting for you in a gymnasium. We gathered some inmates. You cannot approach them,
you cannot touch them. You can sit at the chair
that we designed for you, and we're going to surround
the area of the gymnasium."" 04:15That sounds fun. I enter the room, and we do this thing in France,
I don't know if you have that, but you shake people's hand, you know? So I started shaking people's hands,
""Hello, how are you? My name is JR. What's your name?"" And go around the table, and then I sat. And I spoke with them. A lot of them have been there
since they were teenagers, some of them even from the age of 13. And I've never seen anything like it. And so I told them about my art
and about the idea. 04:43And they asked me a question, they said, ""But what is the purpose of your art?"" 04:48Well, you know, that's a good question. I don't know if I can answer before,
you know, trying a project. So I explained them an idea, and I said,
“Wait, before we start anything, I just want you to know, if there's anyone here in this room
that by being in this project, you might offend some
of your victims outside, I'm not your guy. I'm going to get
too much attention for you. If I were you, don't participate
in this project."" 05:14Six or seven guys stood up
and left the room. I was like, ""Alright."" So we kept on going
and I started photographing them. Very simple, it's just a small
part of the process. I'm not really a photographer. That’s just one part that I use,
and I get to meet them and talk with them. And each of them started
explaining me their story, where they grew up, where they come from, how many years, some of them
spent decades in this prison. 05:37And the thing is that,
I told them, I said, ""Look, this photo is nothing. I need you to go in the next room. I'm going to leave a mic there. And I want you to record
your story from the beginning. I want to understand, you have to talk like,
if you're throwing a bottle in the ocean, I want to understand where you come from. And then what brought you to make
that crime that led you to prison. And if you changed,
explain how you changed and why."" 06:04They all went, some stayed for 10 minutes, some stayed for 20, 30 minutes. Some of them were crying in that place. 06:11Then I went back to my studio
and that's what we do. We print strips of paper
like a giant puzzle, so we have to combine it together. It's all just paper and glue. And then we combine them by numbers, and then we went back there. And we started bringing
everybody in the yard. And we started pasting. Everyone from every gang,
every race, participated. 06:31Now, the thing is, we're still in a supermax security prison. So the guards were like, ""Look, we love you
with your paper and stuff, but we’re going to count
everything you brought in, and we’re going to make sure
you leave with everything out. So every hour we're going to stop
this whole project and make sure there's not
one scissors missing, one brush, one, you know,
bucket, anything."" 06:52So we went through the process, and I had planned two to three days
to paste the whole thing. Those guys were so motivated, that in literally two
or three hours we had done it. 07:03So I said, ""Wait, stop, guys, they're going to bring you
back to your cell, give me a second. I'm going to try to get
some guards to paste with us."" 07:10And they were like, look,
""We love utopianism and stuff, but that’s where it stops.” 07:14""No, just give me a second."" 07:15So I start going to the guards and I say,
""Hey, do you mind participating?"" Fifty ""no,"" one guy said ""yes."" I say, ""Cool, come with me. They're going to show you."" And then another guard and another guard. And that's where the real
walls were falling down, because there's no communication
between those guards and the inmates. 07:31(Applause) 07:35And you know what? From the floor, it was so big
we couldn't see it anyway. You had to send a drone. So remember, again,
you're in a supermax security prison. It's geofencing. 07:46(Laughter) 07:47So we send in the drone, those guys have never seen
a drone their whole life, they were more excited about the drone
than the whole project. And I was so scared because I was like,
""I hope we did the puzzle right. Because if not, it's going to look
a bit ugly from up there."" And that's what you see from up there. 08:03(Applause and cheers) 08:13Thank you. 08:14The whole yard, all their faces. And when you zoom in, actually,
you see the picnic table, you can still see, it looks like a hole,
but it's actually an illusion. And you see the guys walking on it. 08:25Now, the craziest part of all of it is because of that crazy
permit that I had, I literally walked in
without being searched. I had my phone on me. So I started filming in there
and posting it on social media. So this guy there was showing me
his tattoo on day one. And then the evening, he called
his family and they said, ""We saw you on JR's Instagram. It's incredible, we see
what you guys are doing."" 08:51He was so proud the next day he said, ""JR, do you mind me showing my diplomas?"" 08:55They started realizing the impact
of suddenly having a connection with the outside. 08:59Then this guy showed up. His name is Kevin. You know, when I saw him,
I was like, ""Whoa."" In my life, I'll never have a second
chance to ask a guy, hopefully, why he has a fucking swastika on his face. 09:13(Laughter) 09:15And so I ask him,
and he was like, ""Oh, this?"" Almost like he forgot about it. He was like, ""I did this as a gang thing
when I went in prison. But now, if I could, I would remove it."" 09:25I was like, ""OK, do you mind
if I take a photo and I share it?"" 09:28He's like, ""Yeah, sure."" 09:29I share that photo. Now, as you can imagine, on social media, a lot of people were as shocked
and offended as I was. But a lot of people were like,
“That’s strange, because that doesn't connect
with the beauty in his eyes and the humanity in him."" 09:43So I went back to him
and I said, ""Look, Kevin, there's this thing called social media. I know you've been here too long
and you don't know about this, but people are writing comments,
I'm going to read them to you. And I think some of them
you should answer. So we started talking,
and I did many and many videos and asking him again and again,
and he responded and he went deeper and deeper. And it started a chain
of people who were like, ""Let's get this tattoo out of his face."" 10:07So now before we revealed
the image that you saw, I didn't want to throw it
to the world like that. 10:14For now, only the inmates
and I have seen it. We started an app
where you can actually go in, it's totally free, and you can go and click
on any face and hear their story for as much as they want. 10:25(Applause) 10:31I wonder, you know, I've seen it. I saw people telling me that they
heard story, and like a podcast. But I wonder, how would
they feel about it? You know, I wanted the feedback from them. 10:42So I got a permit to go back into prison. And this time I said, let me work
on some more walls, I'll find an idea. So I go back in there
and I started working on the walls, but it was really, the excuse was like,
I need to speak to you guys. So I said, ""What happened, guys?"" 10:56They were like, ""Well, what do
you mean, what happened?"" 10:59I was like, ""I was on the outside,
I couldn't speak to you guys. What was the impact inside?"" 11:03""Oh, the impact inside is pretty simple. Let me tell you for myself, I mean,
my daughter never visited me in 14 years. And now she sat in her bedroom,
and she listened to my audio, and now she sees me every week.” He says, ""You can ask whoever
you want of those guys here, and they'll tell you the same story."" 11:20(Applause) 11:23And he told me another thing happened. ""Is that the guards
started listening to our stories. They treat us differently now."" 11:32Then we started seeing
the walls falling down. So I left a little souvenir
in the courtyard. I was like, ""Let me make one more
wall disappear before I go."" So we pasted the mountains
from behind the wall on the wall. And it's still there, actually. 11:46(Applause) 11:51This one is still in level four,
which is the supermax security prison. And they told me in winter
it becomes all snowy. And so you actually
don't tell the difference between the reality and the wall. 12:02Now, Kevin was still in prison, so I visited him again. And something had changed in him. He was already helping others, and, you know, you could tell that he
almost had forgotten about his tattoo, even if it was still there, because you cannot remove
tattoos in prison. So I bought him a book, and I told him, ""Look,
there's a swastika on the cover, I thought you would like it."" And he laughed. But I said, ""No, seriously,
this is our friend, Art Spiegelman, who wrote it, and he told the story
about his family in the Holocaust."" 12:33And so that night he went
and read the book. And he was really moved. He called his mom and he said, ""Mom, those French people brought me
this book that talks about the Holocaust."" 12:44And she said, ""But you stupid moron. Your family was from Poland. They were hiding Jews. They died in Auschwitz
because of protecting them. And you go in prison
and do this on your face?"" He was in shock. 12:58Couple years later,
which is a couple months ago, he came out. Like many others from the project, almost all of them got moved
to a lower-security prison, and one third of them got freed
because of having good grades and notes by the guards
after the project. So Kevin went out,
and the first thing he did was to go up that hill
that he looked at for 17 years, to look down at the prison
that he was staying in. And then the second thing,
as I promised him, I took him to a doctor
to remove his tattoo. And the session started with the laser,
and it's very painful. And at the end of it, the doctor removed
the laser and she told him, ""Well, who's better than a Jewish doctor
to remove your swastika?"" 13:46(Laughter and applause) 13:53And that's him now. 13:54(Applause and cheers) 14:01You know, we really tried
to bring him here. But his parole officer,
who is actually really nice, he said ""JR, you're pushing too much. He's not going to Canada. Sorry about this.” But he knows I'm here talking about it. 14:14You know, I want to use art as a bridge to make people talk to each other. I'm not an activist, I'm just an artist. I don't try to tell people what to think. I just try to make them think. And I really see art, to me, it's like, it's in the process. That's what's important. And after this whole project,
after everything I showed you, what shook them,
what struck them the most, is that I shook their hand. So at the end, they even
asked me for a hug. 14:43Now I remember
their first question, which was: What is the purpose of your art? Well, art can change things,
but can it change the world? Or can it change a man? Before you answer that question, think, at some point in your life,
have you changed? And if yes, if you did, why can't they? 15:06Thank you. 15:09(Applause and cheers) 15:22Helen Walters: That's amazing,
you're amazing. You also just got back from Ukraine, and I wanted to show us
just another piece of your work. 15:33JR: Oh yeah, that was in Ukraine. The biggest city in the west side
of Ukraine is called Lviv. And a friend of mine
took that photo at the border, he sent it to me,
I printed it 150 feet long. We rolled it as a tarp,
walked through the border with it. It's actually easy to go that way,
you know, to enter Ukraine. So they were like, ""Oh, you're
going to go this way? Sure."" And then we drove to, you know,
I met some people on Instagram, and they came
and picked me up in their car. And then we gathered hundreds of people. We wanted to show Putin's planes
who they were shooting out. 16:08(Applause) 16:11That little girl is actually safe. When she got photographed,
she was coming out of the country. So she’s now in Warsaw, and she’s OK. And since then, actually, we're moving this image all around Europe. So while TED was happening
in the last four days, the image was in Berlin,
Dusseldorf, Venice this morning. And then it will keep traveling
and each time, each place, people are gathering by themselves
and opening it up. 16:37HW: That is amazing, JR, thank you. 16:38JR: Thank you. (Applause) "

You saw the release of Serena in that great yellow
bathing suit last week and when I saw it,
all I could think of was, ""Gosh, why couldn't she have waited
til we sat onstage for TED?"" I was very selfish, I know. So I asked you about that picture, and you said nobody was
supposed to see that picture. What do you mean? 00:30Serena Williams: Well,
actually, it was an accident. I was on vacation,
just taking some time for myself, and I have this thing
where I've been checking my status and taking pictures every week
to see how far along I'm going -- 00:44GK: And sharing it with friends, maybe? 00:46SW: No, actually
I have just been saving it, and I didn't really tell a lot of people, to be quite honest, and I'd been saving it, and you know how social media is,
you press the wrong button and -- 00:57(Laughter) 00:58GK: And there it was. 00:59SW: So 30 minutes later --
my phone doesn't ring that much -- and 30 minutes later,
I missed like four calls, and I'm like, that's weird, and then I picked it up
and I was like, oh no. But it was a good moment. I was gonna wait literally
just five or six more days -- that's OK. 01:14GK: I know, because it was weird,
Serena, because it only said 20 weeks, so it's not like there was
a whole lot of information on it. 01:20SW: Exactly, so that's
what I've been doing all this time. I've been just tracking it. 18, 19 -- every week
I'd just take a picture and save it, and I've been so good about it, and this was the one time that I slipped. 01:34GK: There you go. Well, congratulations. 01:36SW: Yes, thank you. 01:38GK: It really is OK.
When you heard the news, were you excited?
Were you afraid? Were you worried? That you were pregnant, I mean. 01:44SW: So I heard it two days before
the beginning of the Australian Open, which is one of the biggest grand slams. 01:51GK: You found out two days before? 01:52SW: Yeah, so it was
two days before, and I knew. I was nervous. I wasn't quite sure what to think, but I just knew that at that moment it was really important for me
to just focus right there at the Australian Open, and I was definitely not sure what to do. I was like, can I play? I know it's very dangerous, maybe,
sometimes in the first 12 weeks or so, so I had a lot of questions. 02:18GK: But not only did you play,
Ms. Williams, you won. 02:22(Cheers) 02:25SW: Yeah. May I just say, 23 grand slams to you. 02:32SW: Thank you. 02:33(Applause) 02:35GK: While pregnant! 02:36SW: Well, I was looking
for another handicap, so ... no. 02:39GK: Did you play differently that game,
knowing you were pregnant? 02:42SW: I did. It wasn't very easy. You hear all these stories
about people when they're pregnant, they get sick and they get tired. 02:49GK: Have you had morning sickness? 02:51SW: No, I've been so fortunate
and so I haven't. But they get really tired
and they get really stressed out, and I had to really take all that energy, put it in a paper bag, so to say, and throw it away, because I really felt
like I didn't have time to deal with any extra emotions,
any extra anything, because pregnant or not, no one knew, and I was supposed to win that tournament as I am every tournament that I show up. I am expected to win, and if I don't win,
it's actually much bigger news. 03:18GK: Yeah, when you don't win,
that's a big story. 03:21SW: Yes, so for me,
I had to really take anything negative and any emotions
that I was feeling at that point and kind of just bottle them up and really figure out
what the next step for me to do was. 03:32GK: You have a lot of support.
You have a lot of love. Even when I was coming here,
people stopped me at the airport. I was saying to the flight attendant,
the pilot, ""Guess where I'm going?"" They said, ""Oh my God,
we're so glad she's pregnant."" But then you always have
these cranky Yankees. On the way over here, somebody
was telling me about Ilie Nastase, who said some very unkind, inappropriate,
dare I say racial things. You have responded to him. I'm not even going
to dignify what he said, but you responded. Why did you respond? 03:57SW: Well, I think there are
very inappropriate comments, and not only that, I've been
really supportive of my peers and the people that I've worked with. I've been a pro for almost 20 years, and so for me, it's really important
to hold women up, and it's something that these young women, they'll come to the locker room,
they'll want to take pictures with me, and for me, it's just like, I want to be able to be a good leader
and a good example for them. So not only -- 04:20(Applause) 04:21Not only did he have rude things
to say about me and my peers, I felt it was important
for us to stand up for each other and to stand up for myself. And at that point it was
really important for me to say, like, I'm not afraid,
I'm not going anywhere, but this is inappropriate, and there's time and there's
a place for everything. And that really
wasn't the time and the place. 04:43GK: We cut the part where you said
you're not going anywhere, because you'll be 36 in September.
Baby's coming, 36. And your coach said
age is always important, but in tennis it's very important, but he has no doubt
that you're coming back. Have you thought, am I coming back? Will I take some time off? I know the women on the tour are saying, ""How long does it take to have a baby?
Two years will she be gone?"" What are you thinking? 05:04SW: Well, I'm always trying
to defy the odds, you know, so for me everything is really mental. I definitely plan on coming back.
I'm not done yet. I'm really inspired by my sister. She's a year older than me,
and that's something that -- if she's still playing, I know I can play. 05:18(Laughter) 05:20And there's so many -- Roger Federer,
he's a little bit older than me and he's still winning everything,
so I'm like, I know I can do that too. So that's been so inspiring to me,
especially recently, and I know that
it's something I want to do. And my story is definitely not over yet. I was talking to my coach about it, and we were talking about
how this is just a new part of my life, and my baby's going to be in the stands and hopefully cheering for me,
not crying too much. 05:47GK: No, you wrote a beautiful
letter to your baby yesterday that you said -- from the oldest mommy
to the youngest one, to the oldest, to the youngest,
I can't wait for you to get here. A lot of people feel that. I saw you about a year ago,
because I think about your life, Serena. You've had three life-changing things
in a six-month time: pregnant, huge win, fell in love. And when I saw you last year, I was saying, ""How's
your love life? Da da da."" You said, ""I met a guy.
He's a nerdy, kinda geeky guy. You won't know who he is."" I said, ""What's his name?"" 06:17SW: I remember talking
to you about that, yes. 06:19GK: And you said, ""Alexis Ohanian.""
I said, ""I know him!"" He's awesome. But I would never put you
with a nerdy geek, and you said, you neither. 06:27SW: I'm going to be honest
with you, I didn't either, but it's been the best thing for me. 06:31GK: The best thing why? Does that look like a nerdy geek? Look at the shirt. 06:36(Laughter) 06:37No, he's a very nice guy. 06:38SW: You can tell he's into technology. 06:40GK: He's a very, very nice guy. I like him very much. So how did he succeed
when others have failed? How was he the one that you knew,
this is the one for me? 06:49SW: Well, I'm not going to say that, but ... 06:53(Laughter) 06:54GK: Say it, Serena, say it! 06:56SW: Well ... 06:57(Laughter) 07:00Yes. 07:02(Applause) 07:05GK: But you know what I mean. 07:06SW: He is very loving and he's very kind,
and my mom says he's very considerate, and when she said that to me, I was like, you know, he really is, and it's the little things that really
make a huge difference in life. 07:17GK: Like? 07:18SW: Something simple. My fashion company,
we have a show every year, so in our show last year,
I was running around like crazy, because I do everything for the show, and everything for it, so I was running around like crazy, and he, it was a simple gesture
of this shirt that he had, and he just wanted to make sure
that I had the same one, and it was -- it's a weird story. It was better in person, I promise. 07:42GK: Was it a wonderful proposal? Or was it a Beyoncé song? ""If you like it then you
ought to put a ring on it""? Were you feeling pressure to get married? Did you know it was coming? 07:52SW: Yeah, I actually
never felt pressure to get married and I can't say
I'm the marrying type of person. I really love my life. I love my freedom. I heard that kind of changes. But I love everything that I do, and I love my career, and I always felt like I didn't want
anything to interfere with that. I've actually been so career-oriented and in fact, when he proposed, I was almost angry. Not almost. I was angry, because it was right
in the middle of my training season, and I said, ""I gotta win
the Australian Open. I can't fly to Rome."" Because he wanted to take me to Rome, and I said, ""I can't. I gotta win."" But that's how focused I was. 08:30GK: This is a girl that says,
""No, I can't go to Rome."" OK. 08:33SW: But I was really focused
on reaching my goals and I knew at that point there was
one player that I wanted to pass. I wanted to pass Steffi Graf's record, and that really meant a lot to me, and when I put my mind to something, I really am determined to reach it no matter what. 08:48GK: You know, you said that for you -- I've heard you say
that winning is addictive to you. 08:53SW: It is. 08:54GK: What do you mean? 08:55SW: I feel like winning for me
is superaddictive. I feel like once you experience it, you always want to get that feeling again, and when I won my first championship,
I was only 17 years old, but I never forgot that feeling, and I feel like every time I win one, I want to reach that feeling
of your first championship. There's really no feeling
in the world like that. And it's like, all these years of training and being a little kid and playing, and then winning
is a wonderful experience. So for me I've always felt
like I loved that feeling, and obviously I don't like
the feeling of losing. I feel like -- 09:32GK: No, in fact, people close to you
say you're a very bad loser. 09:35SW: I'm not the best loser. 09:37GK: That you're very, very, very bad. Listen, no athlete,
no champion likes to lose. I get that. But they say when it comes to losing,
you are very, very, very bad at it. 09:46(Laughter) 09:48SW: I'm number one at losing too,
so you know, that's all I can say. 09:51(Laughter) 09:53(Applause) 09:55GK: I'm always curious about the dynamic
between you and Venus, because everybody that knows you
and has followed the story knows that you two are very close, and you always bring your A game
in whatever you do, but I often wonder,
when you're playing her, do you bring your A- game
because you want to do something for her or do you bring your A++ game
because you want to crush her. Is it harder for you
playing her or easier? 10:17SW: Well, playing Venus
is like playing myself, because we grew up playing each other,
we grew up practicing together. And it was something
that has been difficult, because she's my toughest opponent. She's tall, she's fast, she hits hard like me, she serves like me. It's really like playing a wall. 10:33GK: She knows you. 10:34SW: She knows where I'm hitting
the ball before I hit it, so it's something that is not very easy, but it's really about,
when I go out there, I really have to shut down my mind
and I have to say to myself, ""You know what? I'm just playing a great player,
but today I have to be better. I don't care who it is,
if it's my sister or it's my friend, today is the day I have to show up
and I have to be better and I have to want it more
than anyone else at this moment anywhere on this world."" 11:02GK: So never on the court
do you fall back for Venus? Because, you know,
it was always Venus and Serena. 11:10SW: Yes. 11:12GK: And now baby sister
has surpassed older sister. Do you feel guilt about that? Do you feel joy in that? Is that a difficult position for you? 11:19SW: I don't feel anything in there. In my life, it still and forever
is always going to be Venus and Serena. She's really love of my life,
she's my best friend, she's my soul mate. I mean -- There's pictures of her pushing me, really low-quality pictures
or else I would have shared them, of her pushing me
in a stroller on a tennis court, and she always took care of me. I used to spend all of my allowance
money on the ice cream truck and stuff, and she would take her money
and give it to me at school and make sure I had something to eat
and she would go without, and that's the kind of person
she actually is since I've always known her. So we always have this incredible
respect for each other and this incredible love, and I think it's important for people
to realize you can be successful but you can still have
a wonderful relationship. On the court we are mortal enemies, but the second we shake hands,
we are best friends again. And if I lose, it might be
a day later for me, but for Venus -- 12:17(Laughter) 12:20GK: There's never a time on the court
where you hit the ball and say, ""That's for seventh grade
when you did the blah blah blah""? You never have any moment like that? 12:28SW: I feel like she should have
those moments, because she's never done
anything bad to me, but I'm the youngest.
I'm the younger sister. 12:35GK: Serena, she's never done
anything bad to you? Really? I have three sisters.
I can think of some stuff I've done bad. 12:41SW: Unless she brainwashed me
to forget them. 12:44GK: No, but the love you have for her
I know is very pure. I know that. 12:47SW: Yes. GK: I know that. 12:48SW: We were always brought up
to be superclose, and we are incredibly close. Not only her. I have three other sisters as well,
and we were always so close. 12:59GK: So before a big match,
the two of you don't get together and say, look, we're going
to go out there and -- there's nothing? 13:05SW: Well, it's funny.
Before the Australian Open, we were in the locker room together, and I always pick on her, so I pulled out
my camera while she was changing. I started taking pictures of her,
which is totally inappropriate, but she was so mad at me. She's like, ""Serena, stop!""
And I was just laughing at her. But that's the kind of relationship
that we have, and like I said, the second we step on the court, it was like, we were
definitely mortal enemies, but the second we stepped off,
and moments before, we're just -- It is what it is,
because at the end of the day, she'll always be my sister. I'm not going to play Australia in -- Well, who knows,
I've been playing forever, but I don't think
I'll be playing in 50 years, say? Let's be safe and say 50 years. 13:45GK: I don't know, Serena.
There's never been anybody like you. When you think about it,
never been anybody who has intersected
gender and race the way you have, the dominance that you have
and the scrutiny that you have. And when you were growing up,
did you say, ""I want to be like that""? Because now little girls
are looking at you saying, ""I want to be like that."" Who was the ""I want
to be like that"" for you? 14:05SW: Well, it's interesting,
and I'm glad you brought that up. For me, when I grew up,
I always wanted to be the best, and I said, if you want to be the best,
you've got to emulate the best. So when I started to go on tour
when I was really young, I would see Steffi Graf,
I would see Monica Seles, and I would even see Pete Sampras, and I would see what they did, and I noticed that Steffi and Monica didn't really talk
to a lot of the other players, and they kind of were on their own, and they were just so focused and I would see Pete Sampras,
the technique that he did, and I was like, ""I want to do that."" So I did that, and I felt
that to be the best, and if you want to be the best, you have to hang around people and you have to look at people
that are the best, because you're not going to be the best if you're looking at someone
that's not at the top level. 14:50GK: People say
nobody works as hard as you. 14:52SW: I'm a very hard worker.
GK: That's what I heard. 14:54SW: People say, ""Oh,
she's talented, she's athletic."" Actually, I wasn't.
I was really small for my age. I grew up when I got older, and I had to work really hard, and I think one of the reasons
why I fight so hard and I work so hard is because I was
really, really, really small. 15:08GK: Yeah. You are no longer small. 15:11SW: No, I'm fully grown now. But I was small when I was really young
for whatever reason. I think Venus maybe ate all the Wheaties. 15:20GK: You know, the other thing
people talk about is your body. Your body brings men
and women to their knees. And I mean in a good way. A lot has been made about your body. It's a work of art,
it's masculine, it's glorious, there's never been anything like it. Did you have body issues
when you were growing up? Have you always been
comfortable with your body? 15:43SW: It's interesting, because
when you're a teenage female growing up in the public eye, it is a lot of scrutiny that you face, and as any female that's a teenager, I definitely was not
comfortable in my body. I didn't like it. I didn't understand why I had muscles. And I stopped lifting weights. I was like, I'm not going to do this. But then after I won the US Open, I realized that my body helped me
reach goals that I wanted to reach, and I wanted to be happy with it, and I was so appreciative of it. I'm always healthy. I'm really fortunate and superblessed, and I felt like not only
am I happy with my body, but I want other people
and other young girls that have experienced
what I've experienced to be happy with themselves. So whatever people say -- masculine, whatever,
too much, too little -- I'm OK with it as long as I love myself. 16:30(Applause) 16:34GK: I know you learn a lot from winning, but what have you learned from losing? 16:39SW: I hate to lose, but I think
losing has brought me here today. The only reason I am who I am
is because of my losses, and some of them are extremely painful, but I wouldn't take any of them away, because every time I lose, it takes a really long time
for me to lose again because I learn so much from it. And I encourage everyone that I talk to -- I'm like, listen, if you lose
or if something happens -- not in sports --
in business or in school -- learn from it. Don't live in the past,
live in the present, and don't make the same
mistakes in the future. That's something
that I always try to live by. 17:14GK: Now you're planning a wedding and I want to know,
is it a destination wedding in the Catskills or Poconos
or are you going to do it in Florida? What are you thinking? Big or small? 17:25SW: We're thinking medium size.
We don't want to do too big, but then we're like, OK, we can't
say no to this person, this person. So we're thinking medium size
and we're just thinking -- My personality is a lot of fun.
Hopefully you can see that today. I'm not too serious. 17:38GK: And you like to dance. And the next chapter
for Serena Williams is what? 17:43SW: Oh, next for me. Obviously I'm going to have a baby and I'm going to stay fit
and kind of come back and play tennis and keep working on my fashion line. That'll be really fun. 17:53GK: Do you know if it's a boy or girl? 17:55SW: I don't. I have a feeling
of one or the other. It's a 50-50 chance, but I have a feeling. 18:01GK: Gayle is a unisex name. Whatever you and Alexis decide,
we are cheering you on! 18:05SW: Thank you for that.
GK: You're welcome. We are cheering you on, Serena Williams.
SW: Thank you so much. 18:10Thank you guys. 18:11(Applause) "

my freshman year of college, which was in 2001,
in case you can't see my wrinkle. Now, as you may have noticed,
I'm six-feet tall, and when I arrived at my chosen university and realized our men's Division III
basketball team averaged five-foot-eight, I abandoned the on-campus
scene and went online. Now, back then, online dating
was pretty close to the plot of ""You've Got Mail."" You'd write long emails
back and forth for weeks, before you finally met up in real life. Except, in my case,
you'd realize you have no chemistry and so now, you're back to square one. 00:34So, while online dating
has changed a lot in the last 17 years, many of the frustrations remain the same. Because here's what it does well. It broadens your pool of potential dates beyond your existing social
and professional circles. And here's what it doesn't do well. Literally everything else. 00:54(Laughter) 00:56A few things you should know about me: I'm an action-oriented overachieving
math and theater nerd, who ended up with an MBA. So, when things aren't working out,
I tend to take a step back, apply my business toolkit
to figure out why, and to fix it. My love life was no exception. 01:12The summer before I turned 30,
I took myself on a relationship off-site. Which means I went camping solo
in Maine for a week, to do a retro on my track record
of mediocre relationships. Because the thing was,
I knew what I wanted in a partner. Kindness, curiosity, empathy,
a sense of purpose. And yet, here's what I chose for online: Ivy League degree, six feet or taller, lives within 12 subway stops of me. It's not that I intentionally
prioritized those things, it's just the easiest to vet for online. It kind of is like a résumé review, which is why these guys
looked great on paper and never quite fit me. 01:51So when I went back online
in the spring of 2016, I decided to reengineer the process
through some classic business tools. First, I went to OkCupid, because I wanted to avoid
the gamification of swipe-based apps. And also, because I wanted
a writing sample. Next, I set up a sales funnel, throwing out any sense of my type, and instead defining the criteria
that would qualify a lead. An inbound message had to do three things: had to be written in complete sentences
and with good grammar; it had to reference
something in my profile, so I know it's not
a copy-and-paste situation; and it had to avoid all sexual content. I figured this was a pretty low bar, but it turns out,
of my 210 inbound messages, only 14 percent cleared that hurdle. 02:34(Laughter) 02:36Next, I wanted to meet in real life
as quickly as possible, because the things I cared about,
I couldn't see online. But the research, and my experience, shows you only need about 30 seconds
with someone to tell if you click. 02:48So I invented the zero date. The zero date is one drink, one hour. With the goal of answering one question: Would I like to have
dinner with this person? Not ""are they the one""? Literally, ""Would I like to spend
three hours across the table from this person?"" You tell them you have a hard stop -- drinks with girlfriends,
a conference call with China -- it doesn't matter, they don't know you. The point is one hour. If it's awesome,
you schedule a first date. And if it's not awesome,
you downshift into entertainer mode and you workshop a few new stories
for your next networking event. 03:23Plus, because it's just an hour,
you can squeeze up to three in one evening and then you only have to do your hair
and pick out one great outfit a week. 03:31The zero date also gave me a chance
to see how they responded to me asking them out. I figured not everyone
would dig my moxie, and I was right. Of my 29 qualified leads,
only 15 replied to my message, and of those, six scheduled a zero date. 03:46My first zero date
was with a set designer. And we were both into yoga and preferred our bagels
with peanut butter, so it looked pretty promising. But two minutes in, I could tell
it wasn't going to be a thing and I was relieved not to be
spending dinner with him. After that, I was a little nervous
about going to my next zero date. But we had agreed to meet
on the Brooklyn Heights Promenade with a flask of whiskey
to watch the sunset, and honestly, it was two blocks
from my apartment. Plus, this guy had a podcast,
I have a podcast, worst case scenario,
we can talk about our podcasts. 04:15Then, Chas set down next to me. And this kind and empathetic man told great jokes
and asked even better questions. He was a lawyer and a writer,
and his eyes twinkled when he laughed and they squeezed tight when I kissed him and at some point in the evening,
our zero date became a first date. And two years later, we have a washer,
dryer and two house plants together. 04:38Now, I can't promise
you're going to end up with house plants. But the point of this story is that online dating
doesn't have to suck. Don't treat it like a game,
and don't treat it like a resume review. Instead, use it to source
and qualify leads and then get offline as quickly
as possible with the zero date. Because the point of this isn't swiping. It's finding your person. 05:01Good luck. 05:02(Applause) "
2,How couples can sustain a strong sexual connection for a lifetime,Emily Nagoski,Sep 2019,"As a sex educator, Emily Nagoski is often asked: How do couples sustain a strong sexual connection over the long term? In this funny, insightful talk, she shares her answer -- drawing on (somewhat surprising) research to reveal why some couples stop having sex while others keep up a connection for a lifetime.", (103K),"Transcript (23 Languages)DeutschEnglishEspañolFrançaisHrvatskiItalianoMagyarPortuguês brasileiroPortuguês de PortugalRomânăTiếng ViệtTürkçeΕλληνικάРусскийСрпски, Srpskiالعربيةفارسىکوردی سۆرانیکورمانجی中文 (简体)中文 (繁體)日本語한국어FootnotesFootnotes00:00I'm sitting in a bar
with a couple of friends -- literally, a couple, married couple. They're the parents of two young children, seven academic degrees between them, big nerds, really nice people
but very sleep-deprived. And they ask me the question
I get asked more than any other question. They go, ""So, Emily, how do couples, you know,
sustain a strong sexual connection over multiple decades?"" 00:30I'm a sex educator, which is why
my friends ask me questions like this, and I am also a big nerd like my friends. I love science, which is why
I can give them something like an answer. Research actually has
pretty solid evidence that couples who sustain
strong sexual connections over multiple decades have two things in common. 00:49footnotefootnoteBefore I can tell my friends
what those two things are, I have to tell them a few things
that they are not. These are not couples
who have sex very often. Almost none of us have sex very often. We are busy. They are also not couples who necessarily
have wild, adventurous sex. One recent study actually found that the couples
who are most strongly predicted to have strong sexual
and relationship satisfaction, the best predictor of that is not what kind of sex they have or how often or where they have it but whether they cuddle after sex. And they are not necessarily couples who constantly can't wait
to keep their hands off each other. Some of them are. They experience what the researchers
call ""spontaneous desire,"" that just sort of seems
to appear out of the blue. Erika Moen, the cartoonist
who illustrated my book, draws spontaneous desire
as a lightning bolt to the genitals -- kaboom! -- you just want it
out of the blue. That is absolutely one normal,
healthy way to experience sexual desire. But there's another healthy way
to experience sexual desire. It's called ""responsive desire."" Where spontaneous desire seems
to emerge in anticipation of pleasure, responsive desire emerges
in response to pleasure. 02:06There's a sex therapist in New Jersey
named Christine Hyde, who taught me this great metaphor
she uses with her clients. She says, imagine that your best friend
invites you to a party. You say yes because
it's your best friend and a party. But then, as the date approaches,
you start thinking, ""Aw, there's going to be all this traffic. We have to find child care. Am I really going to want
to put my party clothes on and get there at the end of the week?"" But you put on your party clothes
and you show up to the party, and what happens? You have a good time at the party. If you are having fun at the party, you are doing it right. 02:42When it comes to a sexual connection,
it's the same thing. You put on your party clothes, you set up the child care, you put your body in the bed, you let your skin
touch your partner's skin and allow your body
to wake up and remember, ""Oh, right! I like this. I like this person!"" That's responsive desire, and it is key to understanding the couples
who sustain a strong sexual connection over the long term, because -- and this is the part
where I tell my friends the two characteristics of the couples who
do sustain a strong sexual connection -- one, they have a strong friendship
at the foundation of their relationship. Specifically, they have strong trust. Relationship researcher and therapist, developer of emotionally focused therapy, Sue Johnson, boils trust down to this question: Are you there for me? Especially, are you emotionally
present and available for me? Friends are there for each other. One. 03:40The second characteristic
is that they prioritize sex. They decide that it matters
for their relationship. They choose to set aside all the other
things that they could be doing -- the children they could be raising
and the jobs they could be going to, the other family members
to pay attention to, the other friends they might
want to hang out with. God forbid they just want
to watch some television or go to sleep. Stop doing all that stuff
and create a protected space where all you're going to do
is put your body in the bed and let your skin
touch your partner's skin. So that's it: best friends, prioritize sex. 04:21So I said this to my friends in the bar. I was like, best friends, prioritize sex,
I told them about the party, I said you put your skin
next to your partner's skin. And one of the partners
I was talking to goes, ""Aaagh."" 04:34(Laughter) 04:35And I was like, ""OK,
so, there's your problem."" 04:37(Laughter) 04:38The difficulty was not that they did not
want to go to the party, necessarily. If the difficulty is just a lack
of spontaneous desire for party, you know what to do: you put on your party clothes
and show up for the party. If you're having fun at the party,
you're doing it right. Their difficulty was that this was a party where she didn't love
what there was available to eat, the music was not her favorite music, and she wasn't totally sure she felt great
about her relationships with people who were at the party. And this happens all the time: nice people who love each other
come to dread sex. These couples, if they seek sex therapy, the therapist might have them stand up and put as much distance
between their bodies as they need in order to feel comfortable, and the less interested partner
will make 20 feet of space. 05:27And the really difficult part
is that space is not empty. It is crowded with weeks or months or more of the, ""You're not listening to me,"" and ""I don't know what's wrong with me
but your criticism isn't helping,"" and, ""If you loved me, you would,""
and, ""You're not there for me."" Years, maybe, of all
these difficult feelings. In the book, I use
this really silly metaphor of difficult feelings as sleepy hedgehogs that you are fostering until
you can find a way to set them free by turning toward them
with kindness and compassion. And the couples who struggle
to maintain a strong sexual connection, the distance between them
is crowded with these sleepy hedgehogs. 06:09And it happens in any relationship
that lasts long enough. You, too, are fostering
a prickle of sleepy hedgehogs between you and your certain
special someone. The difference between couples
who sustain a strong sexual connection and the ones who don't is not that they don't experience
these difficult hurt feelings, it's that they turn towards
those difficult feelings with kindness and compassion so that they can set them free and find their way back to each other. So my friends in the bar are faced
with the question under the question, not, ""How do we sustain
a strong connection?"" but, ""How do we find our way back to it?"" And, yes, there is science
to answer this question, but in 25 years as a sex educator, one thing I have learned
is sometimes, Emily, less science, more hedgehogs. So I told them about me. 07:00I spent many months writing a book about
the science of women's sexual well-being. I was thinking about sex
all day, every day, and I was so stressed by the project
that I had zero -- zero! -- interest in actually having any sex. And then I spent months
traveling all over, talking with anyone who would listen about the science
of women's sexual well-being. And by the time I got home, you know, I'd show up for the party,
put my body in the bed, let my skin touch my partner's skin, and I was so exhausted and overwhelmed
I would just cry and fall asleep. And the months of isolation
fostered fear and loneliness and frustration. So many hedgehogs. My best friend, this person
I love and admire, felt a million miles away. 07:53But ... he was still there for me. No matter how many
difficult feelings there were, he turned toward them
with kindness and compassion. He never turned away. And what was the second characteristic of couples who sustain
a strong sexual connection? They prioritize sex. They decide that it matters
for their relationship, that they do what it takes
to find their way back to the connection. I told my friends what sex therapist
and researcher Peggy Kleinplatz says. She asks: What kind of sex
is worth wanting? My partner and I looked
at the quality of our connection and what it brought to our lives, and we looked at the family
of sleepy hedgehogs I had introduced into our home. And we decided it was worth it. We decided -- we chose -- to do
what it took to find our way, turning towards each
of those sleepy hedgehogs, those difficult hurt feelings, with kindness and compassion and setting them free
so that we could find our way back to the connection that mattered
for our relationship. 09:01This is not the story we are usually told about how sexual desire works
in long-term relationships. But I can think of nothing more romantic, nothing sexier, than being chosen as a priority because that connection matters enough, even after I introduced all of these
difficult feelings into our relationship. 09:26How do you sustain a strong
sexual connection over the long term? You look into the eyes
of your best friend, and you keep choosing
to find your way back. 09:39Thank you. 09:41(Applause) "

this big red button, what would you do? For many people, there’s no greater
motivation to do something than being told they can’t. So, what is it about being told “no”
that triggers this response? 00:29One of the most enduring explanations
for this behavior is what psychologists
call reactance theory. Reactance is a motivational state 
that occurs when people feel their freedom 
is being threatened, and it compels them to take actions 
they see as restoring that freedom. Sometimes this emerges as 
general frustration or direct argument, but the most straightforward response is to simply do the thing 
they were told not to. This behavior plays out in public spaces, like when people ignore health campaigns
they perceive as overbearing, and in private spaces,
like parent-child relationships. However, there are situations 
where something being forbidden actually makes it less tempting. 01:17In 1972, psychologists 
at the University of Colorado wanted to know if a romantic relationship 
facing parental disapproval was more likely to strengthen 
or crumble under the pressure. To answer this question, 
they surveyed 140 couples, varying widely in measures of happiness, but all fairly serious 
in terms of commitment. Only some couples reported perceived
parental opposition to their relationship over the study’s six-month period. But those that did also reported 
a steady increase in love for one another. 01:55The researchers named this trend
the Romeo and Juliet Effect after literature’s most famous
forbidden lovers and concluded that the results were
largely motivated by reactance. But in the decades since this publication, most follow-up studies have suggested
the opposite is true. In fact, the long-term success 
of a romantic relationship can be predicted by the perceived
approval or disapproval of the couple’s friends and family. This trend is known 
as the Social Network Effect. 02:31So why doesn’t reactance win 
out over the Social Network Effect? You might think it’s because we value 
our existing relationships over our potential relationships. But in most cases, 
disapproving friends and family are just voicing negative opinions or 
passively not supporting a relationship. It’s rarely a dramatic choice 
of us or them. And when it comes to parents, most people with good relationships 
with their parents feel they can ignore their parent’s advice
without serious consequences, while people with bad parental 
relationships often don’t care what they think anyway. 03:09So if disapproved relationships are 
more likely to fail, does this mean we’re not willing
to fight to date who we want? Well, it might vary from person to person. One theory is that there’s actually 
two types of reactance: defiant reactance, which is impulsively 
doing the opposite of what we’re told, and independent reactance, which reflects
our deeper desire to make our own choices. For example, if you tell someone with high
defiant reactance to lower their voice, they’ll probably start shouting. Whereas someone with high independent
reactance is more likely to simply ignore the request 
and do what they believe is appropriate. So when it comes 
to relationship disapproval, a defiant person might respond by pursuing
their romance in secret, but that doesn’t change 
how the group’s opinion negatively impacts their relationship. Conversely, someone with a particularly
independent personality might be capable of ignoring their friends’ concerns
and loving whomever they want. 04:18The idea of defiant and independent
reactance is fairly new, and researchers are still working 
to uncover all the motivations behind the Social Network Effect. But these theories help illuminate 
the important relationship between reactance and our competing needs
for independence and inclusion. How we balance these desires varies
across individuals and cultures. But no matter how prone 
to reactance we may be, our social networks are vital 
to our sense of identity and well-being. This is especially true 
in our romantic relationships. Studies have found that support 
from a few close companions can help buffer against disapproval 
from others. And most relationships do better 
once the individuals involved find supportive social networks. This outcome might not seem as romantic
as a forbidden love affair, but it’s actually in keeping 
with the story of Romeo and Juliet, whose embattled relationship couldn't
endure the threats of extreme disapproval. "
2,"The profound power of gratitude and ""living eulogies""",Andrea Driessen,Jul 2022,"Why do we often wait so long to recognize each other's gifts? Why are the truest compliments for the people we love often said only after they're no longer around to hear and savor them? Andrea Driessen makes the case for writing eulogies for the living, sharing the power of ""Gracenotes"" to offer connection on a deeper level and dispel any regrets of waiting until a loved one's death to appreciate their presence in your life.", (44K),"Transcript (10 Languages)Bahasa IndonesiaEnglishEspañolItalianoPortuguês brasileiroPortuguês de Portugalالعربيةမြန်မာဘာသာ中文 (简体)中文 (繁體)00:00I have a death wish. 00:04Now before you just boo me off the stage
for saying such a thing in a pandemic, I'll explain with a little back story, starting with my second grade gym class. This was the longest, most humiliating hour of the week. My PE teacher, Mr. Jensen,
was a former drill sergeant, and I always felt like the weakest kid. On my report card, he checked the boxes corresponding
to what must have been important for kids' physical
development in the '70s. Oh, except the one
on leadership qualities, he left that one unchecked. Then he added a note. He said, ""Andrea
has difficulty kicking balls."" 00:47(Laughter) 00:51My dad, who was always the one to see
people's gifts instead of their limits, wrote a letter back to Mr. Jensen. He said, ""Andrea may have
difficulty kicking balls, but you should see her stand
on her head and do cartwheels."" 01:04(Laughter) 01:06As a kid, I was usually
the smallest on the playground, never athletic, picked last for, you guessed it, kickball. I took solace in my dad's sincere support. But now, as a business owner, I can see that ball kicking
can really come in handy 01:25(Laughter) 01:27Anyway, in that one simple sentence
to a short-sighted gym teacher ""but you should see her,"" my dad showed me that focusing
on strengths more than weaknesses feels really good. That there are other ways
to look at the world and that it's important
to recognize each other's gifts. 01:46So with all that great karma my dad had built up
around appreciation with me, it only seems right that some praise
would ultimately come his way. Long into his fruitful
and active retirement, he was featured in a hometown
newspaper story. The article described the many ways he contributed to our small
Midwestern town. And he sent a copy of that piece
to my siblings and me with a short handwritten note. He was always really modest, so he just said, ""Well, it's better than having
a eulogy read over a casket."" 02:22My dad died seven years
ago at the age of 96, and he was surrounded by family
and friends and two hospice workers. He left this world not 20 feet
from where he’d come into it. He was born and he died
in the same house. I like to think he died
as well as he'd lived. On his own terms. 02:47I had the honor of giving the eulogy, and ultimately he'd chosen
cremation over that ""casket."" As I looked over at my dad's ashes, I had to smile because, you know,
our dad really loved beer. So instead of putting
his ashes in a blasé urn, we put them in a big, shiny beer growler. 03:09(Laughter) So my remarks over the growler
were a sincere tribute to a superb human being. Not unusual as far as eulogies go, except for one thing. He'd already heard it. Those many years earlier,
after I'd received his note about how having nice things
said about you while you're alive beats the alternative, I wrote my dad a letter. And the theme of the letter
reflected a common thread that I had noticed in his long life. The theme of building. Our dad had helped to build
so many things. Gun emplacements in World War II; a new industrial park; a vibrant hobby as a self-taught
and later acclaimed woodcarver; confidence in others; a many-decades-long marriage; a family, a home. And he had the chance to read it all
long before he died. 04:15So that had me asking, why are eulogies only for dead people? Why do we wait so long
to recognize each other's gifts? Why are the truest compliments
and the sincerest sentiments said about people we love when they can't hear and savor
and relish them? And how do we honor all those around us
who are very much alive? 04:45So what if we turn regret on its head and take all that love
and conscientiousness that we habitually
express after people die and do it while they're still here? Because doing that eases the pain
of death and regret for both the dying and the living. So I set out on an intentional quest
to bear witness to people who are dying. As a hospice volunteer, I'm learning that those who are dying, they want to know that they're loved. That they've loved well. They feel regret for all sorts of things. For things they didn't do
and words they didn't say. Deep down, they want to know
that their lives have mattered. They feel really mortal. Because they are. As am I. As are you. 05:45So when we learn a loved one may be dying, we face a pivotal choice. We can choose to say nothing and hope that our words
will sufficiently honor the person who's no longer here with us. Or we can step up and express
our love and appreciation while they're still here. And we can honor all those around us
who are very much alive. I call this intentional honoring
of others “Gracenotes”. And whether they’re written or spoken, they're this means of freely
and openly acknowledging someone's presence and gifts. I know in my bones that these sentiments
lessen the pain of grief and increase its grace. Like a musical grace note, they're that extra embellishment that makes something
beautiful even better. With Gracenotes, we let our family,
our friends, our kids, even our colleagues know
not just that they matter but how they matter. And these notes also help us
to overcome the illusion, the illusion that there'll always
be more time to let others know how they're impacting the world. 07:03So what do you think keeps us
from ""gracing"" each other this way? Lack of time? Fear of feeling awkward? Unresolved anger? Maybe a lack of forgiveness. 07:19With that in mind, I'll tell you
a bit about my friend Sandy. For much of her life, she had this
complicated relationship with her mom. She was holding on
to decades of resentment. Some of it was tied up
in her mom's alcoholism. But now her mom was dying of cancer. And as heart-wrenching as it was to admit, she said sometimes she wanted her to die. Sandy and I happened to go for a walk
not long after my dad passed, and I said I felt this sense of freedom
and a lack of regret, and I thought it had to be because I gave him that note
before he died. So Sandy decided to write her mom a note, and she included
an honoring set of memories about what she did love about her mom. 08:06She called me later, she said, ""You know what? It was like magic. I started liking my mom. I forgave her. I felt compassion for her. My heart got softer."" 08:26Here's the thing. When we're writing a Gracenote, you're not trying to get published
in a poetry anthology. You don't have to sound like Shakespeare. My guess is you're probably not trying
to get a job at Hallmark. Just want to sound like you. You just need to be willing to try. You're aiming for truth,
authenticity, love. What I've learned over and over
is that the pain of regret is always greater than the challenge
of writing a Gracenote. A moment of grace can be that simple
and that profound. It's an experience
that forever touches the dying and those who are left behind. 09:18So what now? You might be sitting there
thinking what you'd say or how to get started. Business groups and long-term
care groups that I speak to use what I like to call
the Mad Libs approach. Maybe you played Mad Libs
in middle school. Maybe you still play Mad Libs. It’s that fun, 
fill-in-the-blank word game. So with a little bit of Mad Libs style,
we get this easy-to-use Gracenotes road map. 09:48""You are the only person I know who ..."" 09:53""I always laugh when I think about ..."" 09:57""You will leave a legacy around ..."" 10:02Bottom line, you can't do this wrong. It's impossible. And if writing’s not your thing, what if you made a video? A drawing? Maybe you're really good
at PowerPoint decks. Could you write a grace sentence? The medium doesn't matter. What matters is the doing. 10:28What I've learned
in this journey of my own and in talking to others
about their losses, is that Gracenotes create
the sense of completeness, contentedness and calm. I vividly recall the last night
my dad was alive. By then he was unconscious,
and everyone else had gone to bed. I sat with him
with my hand softly on his. And on this unrepeatable night, I didn't have to worry
about trying to find the words to tell him all that he'd meant to me and only hope that he could
hear what I said. Instead, I could be present to his dying. I could affirm that if this
was his time to move on, that was OK. I could love him with presence
and with touch, knowing full well that my Gracenote
those many years earlier had been a sincere and thorough
rendering of his life well lived. 11:30Ever since, I've felt very little regret. And I know it's because I shared
my full heart with him before it was too late. 11:42So I hope, I deeply hope, that you don't know anyone
who's actively dying. But given the times we're in,
that may well not be the case. No matter what, I encourage you to just look around. People everywhere
are dying to be seen and heard, to know how they matter. They're dying to get your Gracenote. 12:11So that is my death wish. That you see how your note,
no matter what form it takes, is like an oasis in a desert of people who are thirsty to know
they're making a difference. Like my dad said, it's better than having
a eulogy read over a casket. 12:34Thank you. 12:36(Applause) "
2,The science behind how parents affect child development,Yuko Munakata,May 2021,"Parents, take a deep breath: how your kids turn out isn't fully on you. Of course, parenting plays an important role in shaping who children become, but psychologist Yuko Munakata offers an alternative, research-backed reality that highlights how it's just one of many factors that influence the chaotic complexity of childhood development. A rethink for anyone wondering what made them who they are today and what it means to be a good parent.", (80K),"Transcript (13 Languages)EnglishEspañolFrançaisItalianoPortuguês brasileiroPortuguês de PortugalTiếng Việtעבריתالعربيةفارسى中文 (简体)日本語한국어FootnotesFootnotes00:01A few years ago, a student came up to me
after the second day of my class on parenting and child development. She hesitated for a second
and then she confessed, ""I'm really interested in this material, but I was hoping your class
would help me to become a better parent if I have kids someday."" She was disappointed. We were going to talk
about how parents do not have control in shaping who their children become. She jumped to the conclusion
that my class wouldn't help her. I was caught off guard. Would confronting the science of parenting
and child development, not be relevant to being a good parent? I hope that my class changed her mind. 00:47Parents want what's best
for their children, young and old parents, rich and poor, married and divorced. And parenting books promise to show
how to achieve the best outcomes, to address the difficult decisions
that parents face every day and in the process, to reveal why
each of us turned out the way we did. The problem is that parenting books
send conflicting messages. Tiger parenting or free-range parenting? Parent like the Dutch
to raise the happiest kids in the world or like the Germans,
to raise self-reliant children? The one consistent message
is that if your child isn't succeeding, you're doing something wrong. There's good news, though. The science supports
a totally different message that is ultimately empowering. 01:44Trying to predict
how a child will turn out based on choices made by the parents is like trying to predict a hurricane from the flap of a butterfly's wings. Do you know the butterfly, the proverbial one,
that flaps its wings in China, perturbing the atmosphere just enough
to shift wind currents that make their way to the skies
over tropical white beaches intensifying the water evaporating
from the ocean in a spiral of wind and fueling a hurricane in the Caribbean six weeks after that flutter of wings. If you are a parent, you are the butterfly flapping your wings. Your child is the hurricane,
a breathtaking force of nature. You will shape the person
your child becomes like the butterfly shapes the hurricane in complex, seemingly
unpredictable but powerful ways. The hurricane wouldn't exist
without the butterfly. 02:47""Wait,"" you might ask, what about all the successful parents
with successful children or the struggling parents
with struggling children?"" They might seem to show
the simple power of parenting. But children can be shaped by many forces
that are often intertwined, like successful parents, successful genes, successful peers and a culture of success
that they grow up in. This can make it hard to know which forces
influence who children become. ""OK,"" you might think, ""yes, it's hard to pull apart
all these possible forces, but we can make pretty good guesses
about the importance of parents."" Perhaps. 03:26Well, how many of you know
how a bicycle works? Right, you've seen people riding bikes, maybe you've ridden one yourself or even tried to teach
someone else how to do it. Just like parenting -- you've seen people doing it, maybe you've done it yourself or even tried to teach
someone else how to do it. We can feel confident about what we know. When we say we know how a bicycle works, we think we have something
in our heads like this. Something that relates the pedals
to the chain and to the wheels. But when you ask people to explain
how a bicycle works, they produce drawings like this. And like this. 04:11(Laughter) 04:13People have no idea how bicycles work. Or zippers or rainbows, or even topics they argue
passionately about. When you push people to explain
how these things work, they usually can't. Just caring about something,
like parenting, or feeling confident about it, doesn't guarantee that we understand it. And everyone can't possibly be right
about how parenting works, given how wildly beliefs have varied. 04:45Mothers in a hunter-gatherer society regretted when their children
cut themselves themselves while playing with knives, but they thought the cuts
were worth the freedom to explore. Even within one society like ours, parenting wasn't a common term
until the 1970s. Before then, parents weren't viewed
as active shapers of children's futures. Years from now, people may look back on today's views and feel just as amazed as we feel when hearing about other times and places. 05:19The science could help parents, and potential parents like my student, to understand how they actually shape
who their children become. Millions of children have been studied
to disentangle all those shaping forces that are usually intertwined. These studies follow identical
twins and fraternal twins and plain old siblings growing up together
or adopted and raised apart. And it turns out that growing up
in the same home does not make children noticeably
more alike in how successful they are, or how happy or self-reliant and so on. Imagine if you had been taken from birth and raised next door
by the family to the left and your brother or sister
had been raised next door by the family to the right, by and large, that would have made you
no more similar or different than growing up together
under the same roof. 06:19On the one hand, these findings
seem unbelievable. Think about all the ways
that parents differ from home to home and how often they argue
and whether they helicopter and how much they shower
their children with love. You would think that would matter enough to make children growing up
in the same home more alike than if they had been raised apart. But it doesn't. 06:42In 2015, a meta analysis, a study of studies, found this pattern across
thousands of studies following over 14 million twin pairs
across 39 countries. They measured over 17,000 outcomes. And the researchers concluded that every single one
of those outcomes is heritable. So genes influence who children become. But genes didn't explain everything. The environment mattered too, just something in the environment that didn't shape children growing up
in the same home to be more alike. Some people have looked at these findings and concluded that parenting
doesn't matter. That you would have become
the same person you are today, regardless of who raised you. 07:29On the other hand, and really, I should say
on the other hands, because there are many
caveats to that story, but I'll focus on one. On the other hand, these findings are not all that shocking. If you think about how the same parent could shape different
children in different ways. One child might find it helpful
when her mother provides structure. Her sister might find it's stifling. One child might think
his parents are caring when they ask questions about his friends. His brother might think
they're being nosy. One child might view
a divorce as a tragedy, while his sister sees it as a relief. Same event, different experience. 08:13My husband and I experienced
this concept 20 years ago when we were 30,000 feet
over the Atlantic, flying from Chicago to Stockholm
to work on a research project. The flight attendants
were clearing the dinner trays, people were getting ready to sleep. We hit a patch of bumpy air and a bunch of teenagers
whooped in excitement. Then all of a sudden,
the plane was plummeting, children and food carts hit the ceiling. The plane seemed to stabilize, but then plummeted again. The ceiling panels flew up
into their compartments from the force, revealing wiring inside. Debris came crumbling down on us. People were screaming and sobbing. The plane plummeted again. After an eternity,
the pilot came on and announced, ""We don't know what that was. We don't know what's coming.
Stay in your seats."" My husband came away from that experience
feeling like planes are incredibly safe. 09:15(Laughter) 09:18The airline sent a letter informing us
that we hadn't simply been falling across those thousands of feet
of clear air turbulence. The plane had been subjected
to forces greater than 2G. We learned that planes can withstand
forces many times larger. So my husband feels safe flying. He seems genuinely baffled
by how anyone could feel otherwise. I get that concept,
but only in the abstract. I've never been able to fly
the same way since. Same event, different experience. 09:53Just because an event
doesn't shape people in the same way, that doesn't mean it had no effect. Your parenting could be
shaping your children, just not in ways that lead them
to become more alike. Your parenting could be leading
your first child to become more serious, your second child to become more relaxed. Your first child to want to be like you, your second child to want
to be nothing like you. You are flapping your butterfly wings
to your hurricane children. 10:24This isn't how we typically
think about parenting. It doesn't make for simple advice. How could parenting books tell people
how to raise successful, happy, self-reliant children, if the same parenting
can lead to different outcomes for children in the same home? At this point, you might be thinking, like students in my class sometimes say, ""OK, we get it. development is complicated. And maybe it's not worth studying
because it's too complicated."" But meaning can be made from chaos. Scientists now understand
how babies go from these apparent lumps to become walking, talking,
thinking, social independent beings. They understand this process
well enough to intervene, to test newborns, for example, and treat them for a genetic condition
that used to lead to mental retardation. Scientists are developing ever more
sophisticated understanding of how parents could shape
their children's futures. 11:27Science can tell us a lot. But it will never tell us everything. So what can we do with this? First, know that parents matter. That might seem obvious, but smart people are arguing otherwise, and what seems obvious
is not always true, as we've seen. Second, know that how parents matter
is complex and difficult to predict. For anyone who has ever been a parent,
stop blaming yourself, as if you are in control
of your child's path. You have influence, but you don't have control. For anyone who has ever been a child, stop blaming your parents. 12:08(Laughter) 12:10At least for the idea
that you are defined by them. Stop blaming other parents. A recent survey of thousands of parents
revealed that 90 percent of mothers and 85 percent of fathers feel judged. Close to half feel judged all the time
or nearly all the time by people they know
and by complete strangers. These judgments probably don't reflect
what's best for the kids. How could they, given how profoundly
parenting has varied around the world and across time? And given how the same parents
can shape children under the same roof
in such different ways. Even when parents try their best,
they can't satisfy everybody. There's only so much time. 12:56This is especially true
for dragon parents. The author, Emily Rapp,
came up with this term after her baby was diagnosed
with Tay-Sachs disease. She knew then that Ronan
would never walk or talk. He would likely die before turning four. I did not know that this could also be the fate
of my firstborn son. He was born with a condition that prevents the intestine
from absorbing nutrients or water for the body. It affects one in five million babies. One in five million. It is so rare that one doctor felt confident telling us
that we would be screwed if that's what our baby had. He was the one who had
to break the news to us later. 13:58Dragon parents have a lot
to say about parenting, even though they know
their children will die young, or in my case, even if we have no idea
whether our babies will live. Emily Rapp wrote, ""We will not launch our children
into a bright and promising future, but see them into early graves."" This requires a new ferocity, a new way of thinking, a new animal. We are dragon parents, fierce and loyal and loving as hell. Our experiences have taught us
how to parent for the here and now, for the sake of parenting, for the humanity
implicit in the act itself. Parenting, I've come to understand,
is about loving my child today, now. In fact, for any parent anywhere,
that's all there is. 15:01I had thought that my expertise
in child development would help prepare me
for becoming a parent. Instead, becoming a parent helped me
to see the science in a whole new light. So third, appreciate how powerful
the moments can be because of what they mean for you
and your child right now, not because of what they mean
for your child long term, which you do not know. The activist Andrew Solomon noted, ""Though many of us take pride in how
different we are from our parents, we are endlessly sad at how different
our children are from us."" Maybe we could be less sad
if we were more realistic, if we let go of the notion that our children's futures
are in our control. If we can embrace the complexity
of our children's development that can transform how we approach
those parenting decisions we face each day and empower us to realize
how much more there is to having a child than trying to shape a specific outcome. So much more, which I appreciate every day
in moments with my firstborn son, who is thriving and with his younger brother and the unique paths they are taking. We are not screwed. 16:22(Laughter) 16:24The science of parents and children, butterflies and their hurricanes, can free people to focus
on what is most important and meaningful in our lives. This can make the experience
of being a parent and the experience of having been a child more realistic and satisfying
for everyone involved. And that, I think, is very relevant
to being a good parent. "
2,A second chance for fathers to connect with their kids,"Charles C. Daniels, Jr.",Jun 2022,"Fathers have a profound impact on their children's lives, yet an estimated ten million kids in the US see their dads less than once a month. Through his advocacy and mental health center, therapist Charles C. Daniels, Jr. empowers fathers to be more present by providing mentorship and community, so they learn to forgive their own shortcomings and, most importantly, learn how to reconnect with their kids.", (45K),"Transcript (6 Languages)EnglishEspañolTiếng Việtالعربية中文 (简体)中文 (繁體)00:01Did you know that an estimated 10 million children
in the United States see their fathers less than once a month? 00:14Research tells us what happens
to boys and girls without dads or stable father figures in their lives. Poverty rates double, emotional and behavioral
health issues increase, high school dropout rates increase,
as do crime and prison rates. 00:37And I was no different. I grew up in Georgia without my father. My mother raised me. And let me tell you
something about my mom. Every day before school, she would look
me in the eyes and say to me, ""You are tall, dark and handsome."" 00:59(Laughter) 01:02(Applause) 01:07""And you can do anything
you want in this world if you put your mind to it."" But I didn't believe her. I struggled. Behavioral issues, substance abuse issues, suicidal ideation. I blamed myself
for my father being absent. 01:38I remember I was in college. In my room by myself. ""God, you have to help me use my pain."" 01:50So I went on a journey to find my father. And what I found was shocking. My father had been experiencing an issue
that he needed help in overcoming. He was experiencing his own pain. His absence was not my fault. And in a way, not his fault. Then I thought to myself, what if my father would have had
a caring group of neighbors to support him? It would have made a difference
for the both of us. 02:28Now, there's a lot of reasons that keep
fathers separated from their children. There are the ones
you might think of right away, like estrangement from a mother, substance abuse, sickness
and incarceration. But the reasons that don't get
talked about enough are the ones that exacerbate the problem. Those are the emotions
we don't talk about enough. I'm talking about shame. Guilt. And embarrassment. These emotions can cause so much harm beyond the absence. 03:19Ben was a 32-year-old father at an agency that I run
called Fathers’ UpLift, where we help fathers love,
forgive and heal. And in doing so, they learn to find the beauty
in the pain they've experienced. Now one might ask,
how can pain be beautiful? At Fathers' UpLift, we believe
that pain gives you character, strength and courage. More importantly, there is a mystery
on the other side of pain. For the population we work with, that mystery is a father's child. The warm embrace with your child
on the other side of the mystery, that is beauty. 04:13Ben spent four years
separated from his child due to co-parenting issues. restraining orders and challenges navigating
the family court. But he also experienced shame from not being able
to see his daughter daily, guilt because he was absent and embarrassment because he was unable
to spend time with his daughter on a consistent basis. 04:42Now it is imperative to note that as we stand here today, that through prior relationships
men learn to love and hate. Some of us have limited
experience with love. Therefore, relationships
that emphasize self-love play an essential role in the work we do. Lifelong relationships
are integral to our efforts, with specific emphasis
on an individual's ability to mirror new behavior and connections. 05:21Now, while many fathers like Ben
come to our agency through social service agencies
and correctional facilities, many of them come to us
through word of mouth. They come to our clinic
and can work one-on-one with a licensed therapist and coach. A team of individuals
that provide guidance, advocacy and mentorship. We also offer group therapy. In groups of five to 25 fathers or more, they share stories about their children
and comfort one another as they work to achieve a common goal. They hear stories of triumph and struggle and pour into one another
whenever there is a need. Together, we ensure
that fathers are mentally and emotionally prepared
to be in their children's lives. And when their father
has achieved his goal, he is invited to come back
and be an ambassador and pay it forward. 06:26And last but not least, we ensure that mental health providers, universities and institutions have the tools they need to engage fathers
wherever they are throughout the world, through our online
and in-person instruction. 06:43(Applause) 06:49We work with fathers
as long as they need us. Or, in other words, until they fire us. 06:56(Laughter) 06:59Now there is no easy formula here. Every dad is different. Every kid is different. Every story is different. But there are a few things
we do every time. We are loving our fathers
and the fatherless back to life. 07:19(Applause) 07:23We hug our fathers. We celebrate them on birthdays
and holidays with a call to let them know how much
we appreciate them. And we assume that they have
the power to achieve their goals. We are a consistent
source of support for them as they work to process the mistakes
they've made in the past. For the last few years, we’ve served
over 10,000 fathers in their families. 07:54(Applause) 08:01We've seen fathers accomplish goals, such as gaining shared custody
of their children, loving themselves again and gaining a newfound appreciation for everything they have
experienced in their life. All of our fathers enter our doors
feeling hopeless. But when they leave, over 90 percent of them say
they have an improved sense of identity and self-worth. We've helped fathers
released from jail and prison return home with their worth,
their dignity and their self-respect. 08:36(Applause) 08:41And of course, our work just doesn't benefit fathers. It's for the kids too. A kid blaming himself for something
he doesn't understand. The kid like I was, who struggled and who didn't understand
that fathers are human too. 09:08My father's absence inspired me to create
a safe haven for fathers nationwide. And truth be told, my father is currently leading
a life separated from me as we speak today. Unfortunately, it is not a perfect ending. But it is an important one. It sheds light on the fact
that fathers hurt too. And it is our responsibility to love them
back to life whenever the need exist. 09:43As I stand on the stage, I can't stop thinking
about my seven-year-old son, Clayton, and my one-year-old daughter,
SaMya Grace. 09:55The other day, I asked Clayton, ""What kind of father am I?"" 10:01He looked at me and said, ""Um, you have a mustache,"" 10:06(Laughter) 10:08""Long hair,"" this was before
the haircut, may I add. 10:11(Laughter) 10:13""And even a new computer."" 10:16I was like, ""OK, this is true, son."" 10:20He goes on to say, ""I love it when you buy me games,""
before hugging me -- 10:25(Laughter) 10:28And running back to his room. 10:30(Laughter) 10:33And SaMya Grace. Every time I ask her for a kiss, she puckers up her lips and she runs
to kiss me with an enormous smile. That makes my day every time. When moments like these occur, I understand that I have
the privilege to be present, unlike many of the fathers that walk
through our doors for the first time. Like them, I am far from perfect. Despite my mistakes, my greatest achievement
is being Clayton and SaMya's father. 11:13(Applause) 11:19Millions of fathers today, regardless of their location, can say the same thing. 11:31I must admit, if it had not been
for the individuals in my life that reminded me of how valuable I was, I would not be here today. I'm more than thankful for them
that they loved me back to life. 11:48Fathers that have been absent,
regardless of their past mistakes, deserve a lifeline. And if we are deserving, so are the ones who have lost their way. 12:04Take a moment with me. Fifteen seconds. And I'll keep the time. Think about the people who loved you
when you lost your way. Who huged you when you needed it. Who assumed best intention. Who validated you. And embraced you
even when you felt undeserving. Whoever came to mind, try, just try and be that to someone else. 12:40Thank you. 12:41(Applause) "
2,The mathematics of love,Hannah Fry,Feb 2015,"Finding the right mate is no cakewalk -- but is it even mathematically likely? In a charming talk, mathematician Hannah Fry shows patterns in how we look for love, and gives her top three tips (verified by math!) for finding that special someone.", (169K),"Transcript (35 Languages)Bahasa IndonesiaBahasa melayuCatalàDeutschEnglishEspañolFrançaisHrvatskiItalianoLietuvių kalbaMagyarNederlandsPolskiPortuguês brasileiroPortuguês de PortugalRomânăSlovenščinaSvenskaTiếng ViệtTürkçeČeštinaΕλληνικάРусскийСрпски, SrpskiУкраїнськабългарскиҚазақ тіліעבריתالعربيةفارسىภาษาไทย中文 (简体)中文 (繁體)日本語한국어00:00Today I want to talk to you
about the mathematics of love. Now, I think that we can all agree that mathematicians
are famously excellent at finding love. 00:10(Laughter) 00:11But it's not just because
of our dashing personalities, superior conversational skills
and excellent pencil cases. It's also because we've actually done
an awful lot of work into the maths of how to find the perfect partner. 00:26Now, in my favorite paper
on the subject, which is entitled, ""Why I Don't Have a Girlfriend"" -- 00:31(Laughter) 00:33Peter Backus tries to rate
his chances of finding love. Now, Peter's not a very greedy man. Of all of the available women in the UK, all Peter's looking for
is somebody who lives near him, somebody in the right age range, somebody with a university degree, somebody he's likely to get on well with, somebody who's likely to be attractive, somebody who's likely
to find him attractive. 00:56(Laughter) 00:59And comes up with an estimate
of 26 women in the whole of the UK. 01:04(Laughter) 01:05It's not looking very good, is it Peter? Now, just to put that into perspective, that's about 400 times fewer
than the best estimates of how many intelligent
extraterrestrial life forms there are. And it also gives Peter
a 1 in 285,000 chance of bumping into any one
of these special ladies on a given night out. I'd like to think
that's why mathematicians don't really bother
going on nights out anymore. 01:31The thing is that I personally
don't subscribe to such a pessimistic view. Because I know,
just as well as all of you do, that love doesn't really work like that. Human emotion isn't neatly ordered
and rational and easily predictable. But I also know that that doesn't mean that mathematics hasn't got something
that it can offer us, because, love, as with most of life,
is full of patterns and mathematics is, ultimately,
all about the study of patterns. Patterns from predicting the weather
to the fluctuations in the stock market, to the movement of the planets
or the growth of cities. And if we're being honest,
none of those things are exactly neatly ordered
and easily predictable, either. Because I believe that mathematics
is so powerful that it has the potential to offer us a new way of looking
at almost anything. Even something as mysterious as love. And so, to try to persuade you of how totally amazing, excellent
and relevant mathematics is, I want to give you my top three
mathematically verifiable tips for love. 02:38(Laughter) 02:40OK, so Top Tip #1: How to win at online dating. So my favorite online dating
website is OkCupid, not least because it was started
by a group of mathematicians. Now, because they're mathematicians, they have been collecting data on everybody who uses their site
for almost a decade. And they've been trying
to search for patterns in the way that we talk about ourselves and the way that we interact
with each other on an online dating website. And they've come up with some
seriously interesting findings. But my particular favorite is that it turns out
that on an online dating website, how attractive you are
does not dictate how popular you are, and actually, having people
think that you're ugly can work to your advantage. 03:27(Laughter) 03:28Let me show you how this works. In a thankfully voluntary
section of OkCupid, you are allowed to rate
how attractive you think people are on a scale between one and five. Now, if we compare this score,
the average score, to how many messages
a selection of people receive, you can begin to get a sense of how attractiveness links to popularity
on an online dating website. 03:52This is the graph the OkCupid guys
have come up with. And the important thing to notice
is that it's not totally true that the more attractive you are,
the more messages you get. But the question arises then
of what is it about people up here who are so much more popular
than people down here, even though they have the same
score of attractiveness? And the reason why is that it's not just
straightforward looks that are important. So let me try to illustrate
their findings with an example. So if you take someone like
Portia de Rossi, for example, everybody agrees that Portia de Rossi
is a very beautiful woman. Nobody thinks that she's ugly,
but she's not a supermodel, either. If you compare Portia de Rossi
to someone like Sarah Jessica Parker, now, a lot of people,
myself included, I should say, think that Sarah Jessica Parker
is seriously fabulous and possibly one
of the most beautiful creatures to have ever have walked
on the face of the Earth. But some other people,
i.e., most of the Internet ... 04:54(Laughter) 04:56seem to think that she looks
a bit like a horse. 04:58(Laughter) 05:01Now, I think that if you ask people
how attractive they thought Jessica Parker or Portia de Rossi were, and you ask them to give
them a score between one and five I reckon that they'd average out
to have roughly the same score. But the way that people would vote
would be very different. So Portia's scores would
all be clustered around the four because everybody agrees
that she's very beautiful, whereas Sarah Jessica Parker
completely divides opinion. There'd be a huge spread in her scores. And actually it's this spread that counts. It's this spread
that makes you more popular on an online Internet dating website. So what that means then is that if some people
think that you're attractive, you're actually better off having some other people
think that you're a massive minger. That's much better
than everybody just thinking that you're the cute girl next door. 05:48Now, I think this begins
to make a bit more sense when you think in terms of the people
who are sending these messages. So let's say that you think
somebody's attractive, but you suspect that other people
won't necessarily be that interested. That means there's
less competition for you and it's an extra incentive
for you to get in touch. Whereas compare that
to if you think somebody is attractive but you suspect that everybody
is going to think they're attractive. Well, why would you bother
humiliating yourself, let's be honest? But here's where the really
interesting part comes. Because when people choose the pictures
that they use on an online dating website, they often try to minimize the things that they think some people
will find unattractive. The classic example is people
who are, perhaps, a little bit overweight deliberately choosing
a very cropped photo, 06:33(Laughter) 06:35or bald men, for example, deliberately choosing pictures
where they're wearing hats. But actually this is the opposite
of what you should do if you want to be successful. You should really, instead, play up to whatever it is
that makes you different, even if you think that some people
will find it unattractive. Because the people who fancy you
are just going to fancy you anyway, and the unimportant losers who don't,
well, they only play up to your advantage. 07:00OK, Top Tip #2:
How to pick the perfect partner. So let's imagine then
that you're a roaring success on the dating scene. But the question arises
of how do you then convert that success into longer-term happiness, and in particular, how do you decide
when is the right time to settle down? Now generally,
it's not advisable to just cash in and marry the first person who comes along
and shows you any interest at all. But, equally, you don't really
want to leave it too long if you want to maximize your chance
of long-term happiness. As my favorite author,
Jane Austen, puts it, ""An unmarried woman of seven and twenty can never hope to feel
or inspire affection again."" 07:41(Laughter) 07:44Thanks a lot, Jane. What do you know about love? 07:46(Laughter) 07:47So the question is then, how do you know when
is the right time to settle down, given all the people
that you can date in your lifetime? Thankfully, there's a rather delicious bit
of mathematics that we can use to help us out here,
called optimal stopping theory. So let's imagine, then, that you start dating when you're 15 and ideally, you'd like to be married
by the time that you're 35. And there's a number of people that you could potentially
date across your lifetime, and they'll be at varying
levels of goodness. Now the rules are that once
you cash in and get married, you can't look ahead to see
what you could have had, and equally, you can't go back
and change your mind. In my experience at least, I find that typically people
don't much like being recalled years after being passed up
for somebody else, or that's just me. 08:33So the math says then
that what you should do in the first 37 percent
of your dating window, you should just reject everybody
as serious marriage potential. 08:43(Laughter) 08:45And then, you should pick
the next person that comes along that is better than everybody
that you've seen before. So here's the example. Now if you do this, it can be
mathematically proven, in fact, that this is the best possible way of maximizing your chances
of finding the perfect partner. Now unfortunately, I have to tell you that
this method does come with some risks. For instance, imagine
if your perfect partner appeared during your first 37 percent. Now, unfortunately,
you'd have to reject them. 09:18(Laughter) 09:22Now, if you're following the maths, I'm afraid no one else comes along that's better than anyone
you've seen before, so you have to go on
rejecting everyone and die alone. 09:32(Laughter) 09:34Probably surrounded by cats ... 09:36(Laughter) 09:37nibbling at your remains. 09:39OK, another risk is,
let's imagine, instead, that the first people that you dated
in your first 37 percent are just incredibly dull,
boring, terrible people. That's OK, because
you're in your rejection phase, so that's fine, you can reject them. But then imagine
the next person to come along is just marginally less boring,
dull and terrible ... 10:01(Laughter) 10:02than everybody that you've seen before. Now, if you are following the maths,
I'm afraid you have to marry them ... 10:08(Laughter) 10:09and end up in a relationship
which is, frankly, suboptimal. Sorry about that. But I do think that there's an opportunity
here for Hallmark to cash in on and really cater for this market. A Valentine's Day card like this. 10:20(Laughter) 10:21""My darling husband,
you are marginally less terrible than the first 37 percent
of people I dated."" 10:26(Laughter) 10:28It's actually more romantic
than I normally manage. 10:31(Laughter) 10:33OK, so this method doesn't give you
a 100 percent success rate, but there's no other possible
strategy that can do any better. And actually, in the wild,
there are certain types of fish which follow and employ
this exact strategy. So they reject every possible
suitor that turns up in the first 37 percent
of the mating season, and then they pick the next fish
that comes along after that window that's, I don't know, bigger and burlier than all of the fish
that they've seen before. I also think that subconsciously,
humans, we do sort of do this anyway. We give ourselves a little bit of time
to play the field, get a feel for the marketplace
or whatever when we're young. And then we only start looking seriously
at potential marriage candidates once we hit our mid-to-late 20s. I think this is conclusive proof,
if ever it were needed, that everybody's brains are prewired
to be just a little bit mathematical. 11:27OK, so that was Top Tip #2. Now, Top Tip #3: How to avoid divorce. OK, so let's imagine then
that you picked your perfect partner and you're settling into
a lifelong relationship with them. Now, I like to think that everybody
would ideally like to avoid divorce, apart from, I don't know,
Piers Morgan's wife, maybe? 11:48(Laughter) 11:50But it's a sad fact of modern life that one in two marriages
in the States ends in divorce, with the rest of the world
not being far behind. Now, you can be forgiven, perhaps for thinking that the arguments
that precede a marital breakup are not an ideal candidate
for mathematical investigation. For one thing, it's very hard to know what you should be measuring
or what you should be quantifying. But this didn't stop a psychologist,
John Gottman, who did exactly that. Gottman observed hundreds of couples
having a conversation and recorded, well,
everything you can think of. So he recorded what was said
in the conversation, he recorded their skin conductivity, he recorded their facial expressions, their heart rates, their blood pressure, basically everything apart from whether
or not the wife was actually always right, which incidentally she totally is. But what Gottman and his team found was that one of the most
important predictors for whether or not a couple
is going to get divorced was how positive or negative each partner
was being in the conversation. 12:59Now, couples that were very low-risk scored a lot more positive points
on Gottman's scale than negative. Whereas bad relationships, by which I mean,
probably going to get divorced, they found themselves getting
into a spiral of negativity. Now just by using these very simple ideas, Gottman and his group were able to predict whether a given couple
was going to get divorced with a 90 percent accuracy. But it wasn't until he teamed up
with a mathematician, James Murray, that they really started to understand what causes these negativity spirals
and how they occur. And the results that they found, I think, are just incredibly
impressively simple and interesting. So these equations predict how the wife
or husband is going to respond in their next turn of the conversation, how positive or negative
they're going to be. And these equations depend on the mood of the person
when they're on their own, the mood of the person when
they're with their partner, but most importantly, they depend on how much the husband and wife
influence one another. 14:02Now, I think it's important
to point out at this stage, that these exact equations
have also been shown to be perfectly able at describing what happens between two countries
in an arms race. 14:15(Laughter) 14:18So that an arguing couple
spiraling into negativity and teetering on the brink of divorce is actually mathematically equivalent
to the beginning of a nuclear war. 14:28(Laughter) 14:31But the really important term
in this equation is the influence that people
have on one another, and in particular, something called
""the negativity threshold."" Now, the negativity threshold, you can think of as
how annoying the husband can be before the wife starts to get
really pissed off, and vice versa. Now, I always thought that good marriages
were about compromise and understanding and allowing the person
to have the space to be themselves. So I would have thought that perhaps
the most successful relationships were ones where there was
a really high negativity threshold. Where couples let things go and only brought things up
if they really were a big deal. But actually, the mathematics
and subsequent findings by the team have shown the exact opposite is true. The best couples,
or the most successful couples, are the ones with a really low
negativity threshold. These are the couples
that don't let anything go unnoticed and allow each other
some room to complain. These are the couples that are continually
trying to repair their own relationship, that have a much more positive
outlook on their marriage. Couples that don't let things go and couples that don't let trivial things
end up being a really big deal. 15:44Now of course, it takes a bit more
than just a low negativity threshold and not compromising
to have a successful relationship. But I think that it's quite interesting to know that there is really
mathematical evidence to say that you should never
let the sun go down on your anger. 16:02So those are my top three tips of how maths can help you
with love and relationships. But I hope, that aside from
their use as tips, they also give you a little bit of insight
into the power of mathematics. Because for me, equations
and symbols aren't just a thing. They're a voice that speaks out
about the incredible richness of nature and the startling simplicity in the patterns that twist and turn
and warp and evolve all around us, from how the world works to how we behave. So I hope that perhaps,
for just a couple of you, a little bit of insight
into the mathematics of love can persuade you to have
a little bit more love for mathematics. 16:40Thank you. 16:41(Applause) "
2,A little-told tale of sex and sensuality,Shereen El Feki,Jan 2014,"“If you really want to know a people, start by looking inside their bedrooms,"" says Shereen El Feki, who traveled through the Middle East for five years, talking to people about sex. While those conversations reflected rigid norms and deep repression, El Feki also discovered that sexual conservatism in the Arab world is a relatively new thing. She wonders: could a re-emergence of public dialogue lead to more satisfying, and safer, sex lives?", (73K),"Transcript (28 Languages)Bahasa IndonesiaDeutschEnglishEspañolFrançaisHrvatskiItalianoNederlandsPolskiPortuguês brasileiroPortuguês de PortugalRomânăTiếng ViệtTürkçeČeštinaΕλληνικάРусскийСрпски, Srpskiбългарскиעבריתالعربيةاُردُوفارسىภาษาไทย中文 (简体)中文 (繁體)日本語한국어00:00So when I was in Morocco, in Casablanca, not so long ago, I met a young unmarried mother called Faiza. Faiza showed me photos of her infant son and she told me the story of his conception,
pregnancy, and delivery. 00:19It was a remarkable tale, but Faiza saved the best for last. ""You know, I am a virgin,"" she told me. ""I have two medical certificates to prove it."" 00:33This is the modern Middle East, where two millennia after the coming of Christ, virgin births are still a fact of life. 00:42Faiza's story is just one of hundreds I've heard 
over the years, traveling across the Arab region talking to people about sex. Now, I know this might sound like a dream job, or possibly a highly dubious occupation, 00:58but for me, it's something else altogether. I'm half Egyptian, and I'm Muslim. But I grew up in Canada, far from my Arab roots. 01:07Like so many who straddle East and West, I've been drawn, over the years, to try to better
understand my origins. That I chose to look at sex comes from 
my background in HIV/AIDS, as a writer and a researcher and an activist. Sex lies at the heart of an emerging epidemic
in the Middle East and North Africa, which is one of only two regions in the world
where HIV/AIDS is still on the rise. 01:35Now sexuality is an incredibly powerful lens with which to study any society, because what happens in our intimate lives is reflected by forces on a bigger stage: in politics and economics, in religion and tradition, 
in gender and generations. As I found, if you really want to know a people, you start by looking inside their bedrooms. 02:01Now to be sure, the Arab world is vast and varied. But running across it are three red lines -- these are topics you are not supposed 
to challenge in word or deed. 02:13The first of these is politics. But the Arab Spring has changed all that, in uprisings which have blossomed 
across the region since 2011. Now while those in power, old and new, continue to cling to business as usual, millions are still pushing back, and pushing forward to what they hope
will be a better life. 02:36That second red line is religion. But now religion and politics are connected, with the rise of such groups as the 
Muslim Brotherhood. And some people, at least, are starting 
to ask questions about the role of Islam in public and private life. 02:54You know, as for that third red line, 
that off-limits subject, what do you think it might be? 03:00Audience: Sex. 03:01Shereen El Feki: Louder, I can't hear you. 03:02Audience: Sex. 03:03SEF: Again, please don't be shy. 03:05Audience: Sex. 03:06SEF: Absolutely, that's right, it's sex. (Laughter) Across the Arab region, the only accepted
context for sex is marriage -- approved by your parents, sanctioned by religion and registered by the state. Marriage is your ticket to adulthood. If you don't tie the knot, you can't 
move out of your parents' place, and you're not supposed to be having sex, and you're definitely not supposed 
to be having children. 03:37It's a social citadel; it's an impregnable fortress which resists any assault, any alternative. And around the fortress is this vast field of taboo against premarital sex, against condoms, against abortion, against homosexuality, you name it. 03:59Faiza was living proof of this. Her virginity statement was 
not a piece of wishful thinking. Although the major religions of the region
extoll premarital chastity, in a patriarchy, boys will be boys. Men have sex before marriage, and people more or less turn a blind eye. 04:21Not so for women, who are expected to be virgins 
on their wedding night -- that is, to turn up with your hymen intact. This is not a question of individual concern, this is a matter of family honor, 
and in particular, men's honor. 04:39And so women and their relatives will go to great lengths to preserve 
this tiny piece of anatomy -- from female genital mutilation, to virginity testing, to hymen repair surgery. 04:52Faiza chose a different route: non-vaginal sex. Only she became pregnant all the same. But Faiza didn't actually realize this, because there's so little 
sexuality education in schools, and so little communication in the family. 05:11When her condition became hard to hide, Faiza's mother helped her flee 
her father and brothers. This is because honor killings are a real threat for untold numbers of women in the Arab region. And so when Faiza eventually fetched up at 
a hospital in Casablanca, the man who offered to help her, instead tried to rape her. 05:38Sadly, Faiza is not alone. In Egypt, where my research is focused, I have seen plenty of trouble 
in and out of the citadel. There are legions of young men who can't afford to get married, because marriage has become 
a very expensive proposition. They are expected to bear the burden
of costs in married life, but they can't find jobs. This is one of the major drivers 
of the recent uprisings, and it is one of the reasons for the 
rising age of marriage in much of the Arab region. 06:12There are career women who want to get married, but can't find a husband, because they defy gender expectations, or as one young female doctor 
in Tunisia put it to me, ""The women, they are becoming more and more open. But the man, he is still at the prehistoric stage."" 06:32And then there are men and women who 
cross the heterosexual line, who have sex with their own sex, or who have a different gender identity. They are on the receiving end of laws
which punish their activities, even their appearance. And they face a daily struggle with social stigma, with family despair, and with religious fire and brimstone. 06:57Now, it's not as if it's all rosy 
in the marital bed either. Couples who are looking for greater happiness, greater sexual happiness in their married lives, but are at a loss of how to achieve it, especially wives, who are afraid 
of being seen as bad women if they show some spark in the bedroom. 07:16And then there are those whose marriages are actually a veil for prostitution. They have been sold by their families, often to wealthy Arab tourists. This is just one face of a booming 
sex trade across the Arab region. 07:32Now raise your hand if any of 
this is sounding familiar to you, from your part of the world. Yeah. It's not as if the Arab world
has a monopoly on sexual hangups. 07:46And although we don't yet have
an Arab Kinsey Report to tell us exactly what's happening 
inside bedrooms across the Arab region, It's pretty clear that 
something is not right. Double standards for men and women, sex as a source of shame, family control limiting individual choices, and a vast gulf between appearance and reality: what people are doing and what they're willing to admit to, and a general reluctance to move 
beyond private whispers to a serious and sustained public discussion. 08:23As one doctor in Cairo summed it up for me, ""Here, sex is the opposite of sport. Football, everybody talks about it, but hardly anyone plays. But sex, everybody is doing it, but nobody wants to talk about it.""
(Laughter) 08:40(Music) (In Arabic) 08:51SEF: I want to give you a piece of advice, which if you follow it,
will make you happy in life. 08:58When your husband reaches out to you, when he seizes a part of your body, sigh deeply and look at him lustily. 09:06When he penetrates you with his penis, try to talk flirtatiously and 
move yourself in harmony with him. 09:14Hot stuff! And it might sound that these handy hints come from ""The Joy of Sex"" or YouPorn. But in fact, they come from
a 10th-century Arabic book called ""The Encyclopedia of Pleasure,"" which covers sex from aphrodisiacs to zoophilia, and everything in between. 09:34The Encyclopedia is just one 
in a long line of Arabic erotica, much of it written by religious scholars. Going right back to the Prophet Muhammad, there is a rich tradition in Islam of talking frankly about sex: not just its problems, but also its pleasures, and not just for men, but also for women. A thousand years ago, we used to have 
whole dictionaries of sex in Arabic. Words to cover every conceivable sexual feature, position and preference, a body of language that was rich enough to make up the body 
of the woman you see on this page. 10:17Today, this history is largely unknown 
in the Arab region. Even by educated people, who often
feel more comfortable talking about sex in a foreign language than they do
in their own tongue. Today's sexual landscape looks
a lot like Europe and America on the brink of the sexual revolution. 10:36But while the West has opened on sex, what we found is that Arab societies appear
to have been moving in the opposite direction. In Egypt and many of its neighbors, this closing down is part of a wider closing in political, social and cultural thought. And it is the product of a complex historical process, one which has gained ground with the rise 
of Islamic conservatism since the late 1970s. ""Just say no"" is what conservatives 
around the world say to any challenge to the sexual status quo. In the Arab region, they brand these attempts
as a Western conspiracy to undermine traditional Arab
and Islamic values. But what's really at stake here is one of their most powerful tools of control: sex wrapped up in religion. 11:32But history shows us that 
even as recently as our fathers' and grandfathers' day, there have been times of greater pragmatism, and tolerance, and a willingness
to consider other interpretations: be it abortion, or masturbation, or even 
the incendiary topic of homosexuality. It is not black and white,
as conservatives would have us believe. In these, as in so many other matters, Islam offers us at least 50 shades of gray. (Laughter) 12:08Over my travels, I've met men and women 
across the Arab region who've been exploring that spectrum -- sexologists who are trying
to help couples find greater happiness in their marriages, innovators who are managing to get 
sexuality education into schools, small groups of men and women, lesbian, gay, transgendered, transsexual, who are reaching out to their peers with online initiatives and real-world support. Women, and increasingly men,
who are starting to speak out and push back against sexual violence on the streets and in the home. Groups that are trying to help sex workers
protect themselves against HIV and other occupational hazards, and NGOs that are helping unwed mothers like Faiza find a place in society, and critically,
stay with their kids. 13:06Now these efforts are small, 
they're often underfunded, and they face formidable opposition. But I am optimistic that, in the long run, times are changing, and they and their ideas will gain ground. Social change doesn't happen in the Arab region
through dramatic confrontation, beating or indeed baring of breasts, but rather through negotiation. 13:33What we're talking here is not about a 
sexual revolution, but a sexual evolution, 
learning from other parts of the world, adapting to local conditions, forging our own path,
not following one blazed by another. That path, I hope, will one day lead us 
to the right to control our own bodies, and to access the information 
and services we need to lead satisfying and safe sexual lives. The right to express our ideas freely, to marry whom we choose, 
to choose our own partners, to be sexually active or not,
to decide whether to have children and when, all this without violence or force or discrimination. 14:22Now we are very far from this 
across the Arab region, and so much needs to change: law, education, media, the economy, the list goes on and on, and it is the work of a generation, at least. 14:40But it begins with a journey that I myself have made, asking hard questions of received wisdoms in sexual life. And it is a journey which has
only served to strengthen my faith, and my appreciation of local histories and cultures by showing me possibilities 
where I once only saw absolutes. 15:01Now given the turmoil in many
countries in the Arab region, talking about sex, 
challenging the taboos, seeking alternatives might sound like
something of a luxury. 15:13But at this critical moment in history, if we do not anchor freedom and justice, dignity and equality, privacy and autonomy in our personal lives,
in our sexual lives, we will find it very hard to achieve in public life. 15:32The political and the sexual are intimate bedfellows,
and that is true for us all. no matter where we live and love. 15:42Thank you. 15:43(Applause) "

was pursuing happiness. Everyone said the path
to happiness was success, so I searched for that ideal job, that perfect boyfriend,
that beautiful apartment. But instead of ever feeling fulfilled, I felt anxious and adrift. And I wasn't alone; my friends --
they struggled with this, too. 00:28footnotefootnoteEventually, I decided to go
to graduate school for positive psychology to learn what truly makes people happy. But what I discovered there
changed my life. The data showed that chasing happiness
can make people unhappy. And what really struck me was this: the suicide rate has been rising
around the world, and it recently reached
a 30-year high in America. Even though life is getting
objectively better by nearly every conceivable standard, more people feel hopeless, depressed and alone. There's an emptiness
gnawing away at people, and you don't have to be
clinically depressed to feel it. Sooner or later, I think we all wonder: Is this all there is? And according to the research,
what predicts this despair is not a lack of happiness. It's a lack of something else, a lack of having meaning in life. 01:30footnotefootnoteBut that raised some questions for me. Is there more to life than being happy? And what's the difference
between being happy and having meaning in life? Many psychologists define happiness
as a state of comfort and ease, feeling good in the moment. Meaning, though, is deeper. The renowned psychologist
Martin Seligman says meaning comes from belonging to
and serving something beyond yourself and from developing the best within you. Our culture is obsessed with happiness, but I came to see that seeking meaning
is the more fulfilling path. And the studies show that people
who have meaning in life, they're more resilient, they do better in school and at work, and they even live longer. 02:19So this all made me wonder: How can we each live more meaningfully? To find out, I spent five years
interviewing hundreds of people and reading through thousands
of pages of psychology, neuroscience and philosophy. Bringing it all together, I found that there are what I call
four pillars of a meaningful life. And we can each create lives of meaning by building some or all
of these pillars in our lives. 02:49footnotefootnoteThe first pillar is belonging. Belonging comes
from being in relationships where you're valued
for who you are intrinsically and where you value others as well. But some groups and relationships
deliver a cheap form of belonging; you're valued for what you believe, for who you hate, not for who you are. True belonging springs from love. It lives in moments among individuals, and it's a choice -- you can choose
to cultivate belonging with others. 03:20Here's an example. Each morning, my friend Jonathan
buys a newspaper from the same street vendor in New York. They don't just conduct
a transaction, though. They take a moment to slow down, talk, and treat each other like humans. But one time, Jonathan
didn't have the right change, and the vendor said, ""Don't worry about it."" But Jonathan insisted on paying, so he went to the store
and bought something he didn't need to make change. But when he gave the money to the vendor, the vendor drew back. He was hurt. He was trying to do something kind, but Jonathan had rejected him. 04:02footnotefootnoteI think we all reject people in small ways
like this without realizing it. I do. I'll walk by someone I know
and barely acknowledge them. I'll check my phone
when someone's talking to me. These acts devalue others. They make them feel
invisible and unworthy. But when you lead with love,
you create a bond that lifts each of you up. 04:25footnotefootnoteFor many people, belonging
is the most essential source of meaning, those bonds to family and friends. For others, the key to meaning
is the second pillar: purpose. Now, finding your purpose
is not the same thing as finding that job that makes you happy. Purpose is less about what you want
than about what you give. A hospital custodian told me
her purpose is healing sick people. Many parents tell me, ""My purpose is raising my children."" The key to purpose
is using your strengths to serve others. Of course, for many of us,
that happens through work. That's how we contribute and feel needed. But that also means
that issues like disengagement at work, unemployment, low labor force participation -- these aren't just economic problems,
they're existential ones, too. Without something worthwhile to do, people flounder. Of course, you don't have to find
purpose at work, but purpose gives you
something to live for, some ""why"" that drives you forward. 05:31footnotefootnoteThe third pillar of meaning
is also about stepping beyond yourself, but in a completely different way: transcendence. Transcendent states are those rare moments when you're lifted above
the hustle and bustle of daily life, your sense of self fades away, and you feel connected
to a higher reality. For one person I talked to,
transcendence came from seeing art. For another person, it was at church. For me, I'm a writer,
and it happens through writing. Sometimes I get so in the zone
that I lose all sense of time and place. These transcendent
experiences can change you. One study had students look up
at 200-feet-tall eucalyptus trees for one minute. But afterwards
they felt less self-centered, and they even behaved more generously when given the chance to help someone. 06:21footnotefootnoteBelonging, purpose, transcendence. Now, the fourth pillar
of meaning, I've found, tends to surprise people. The fourth pillar is storytelling, the story you tell yourself
about yourself. Creating a narrative from the events
of your life brings clarity. It helps you understand
how you became you. But we don't always realize
that we're the authors of our stories and can change the way we're telling them. Your life isn't just a list of events. You can edit, interpret
and retell your story, even as you're constrained by the facts. 06:59footnotefootnoteI met a young man named Emeka,
who'd been paralyzed playing football. After his injury, Emeka told himself, ""My life was great playing football, but now look at me."" People who tell stories like this -- ""My life was good. Now it's bad."" -- tend to be more anxious and depressed. And that was Emeka for a while. But with time, he started
to weave a different story. His new story was, ""Before my injury,
my life was purposeless. I partied a lot and was
a pretty selfish guy. But my injury made me realize
I could be a better man."" That edit to his story
changed Emeka's life. After telling the new story to himself, Emeka started mentoring kids, and he discovered what his purpose was: serving others. The psychologist Dan McAdams
calls this a ""redemptive story,"" where the bad is redeemed by the good. People leading meaningful
lives, he's found, tend to tell stories about their lives defined by redemption, growth and love. 08:08But what makes people
change their stories? Some people get help from a therapist, but you can do it on your own, too, just by reflecting
on your life thoughtfully, how your defining experiences shaped you, what you lost, what you gained. That's what Emeka did. You won't change your story overnight; it could take years and be painful. After all, we've all suffered,
and we all struggle. But embracing those painful memories
can lead to new insights and wisdom, to finding that good that sustains you. 08:42Belonging, purpose,
transcendence, storytelling: those are the four pillars of meaning. When I was younger, I was lucky enough to be surrounded
by all of the pillars. My parents ran a Sufi meetinghouse
from our home in Montreal. Sufism is a spiritual practice
associated with the whirling dervishes and the poet Rumi. Twice a week, Sufis would come to our home to meditate, drink Persian tea,
and share stories. Their practice also involved
serving all of creation through small acts of love, which meant being kind
even when people wronged you. But it gave them a purpose:
to rein in the ego. 09:28Eventually, I left home for college and without the daily grounding
of Sufism in my life, I felt unmoored. And I started searching for those things
that make life worth living. That's what set me on this journey. Looking back, I now realize that the Sufi house
had a real culture of meaning. The pillars were part of the architecture, and the presence of the pillars
helped us all live more deeply. 09:54footnotefootnoteOf course, the same principle applies in other strong communities as well -- good ones and bad ones. Gangs, cults: these are cultures of meaning
that use the pillars and give people
something to live and die for. But that's exactly why we as a society must offer better alternatives. We need to build these pillars
within our families and our institutions to help people become their best selves. But living a meaningful life takes work. It's an ongoing process. As each day goes by,
we're constantly creating our lives, adding to our story. And sometimes we can get off track. 10:36Whenever that happens to me, I remember a powerful experience
I had with my father. Several months after
I graduated from college, my dad had a massive heart attack
that should have killed him. He survived, and when I asked him
what was going through his mind as he faced death, he said all he could think about
was needing to live so he could be there
for my brother and me, and this gave him the will
to fight for life. When he went under anesthesia
for emergency surgery, instead of counting backwards from 10, he repeated our names like a mantra. He wanted our names to be
the last words he spoke on earth if he died. 11:21My dad is a carpenter and a Sufi. It's a humble life, but a good life. Lying there facing death,
he had a reason to live: love. His sense of belonging within his family, his purpose as a dad, his transcendent meditation,
repeating our names -- these, he says, are the reasons
why he survived. That's the story he tells himself. 11:47That's the power of meaning. Happiness comes and goes. But when life is really good and when things are really bad, having meaning gives you
something to hold on to. 12:00Thank you. 12:01(Applause) "
2,The brain in love,Helen Fisher,Jul 2008,"Why do we crave love so much, even to the point that we would die for it? To learn more about our very real, very physical need for romantic love, Helen Fisher and her research team took MRIs of people in love -- and people who had just been dumped.", (217K),"Transcript (34 Languages)Bahasa IndonesiaDeutschEesti keelEnglishEspañolFrançaisHrvatskiItalianoMagyarNederlandsPolskiPortuguês brasileiroPortuguês de PortugalRomânăShqipSlovenščinaSvenskaTiếng ViệtTürkçeČeštinaΕλληνικάРусскийСрпски, SrpskiУкраїнськабългарскиעבריתالعربيةفارسىमराठीภาษาไทย中文 (简体)中文 (繁體)日本語한국어00:00I and my colleagues Art Aron
and Lucy Brown and others, have put 37 people who are madly in love
into a functional MRI brain scanner. 17 who were happily in love,
15 who had just been dumped, and we're just starting
our third experiment: studying people who report
that they're still in love after 10 to 25 years of marriage. So, this is the short story
of that research. 00:24In the jungles of Guatemala,
in Tikal, stands a temple. It was built by the grandest Sun King,
of the grandest city-state, of the grandest civilization
of the Americas, the Mayas. His name was Jasaw Chan K'awiil. He stood over six feet tall. He lived into his 80s, and he was buried beneath
this monument in 720 AD. And Mayan inscriptions proclaim
that he was deeply in love with his wife. So, he built a temple
in her honor, facing his. And every spring and autumn,
exactly at the equinox, the sun rises behind his temple, and perfectly bathes her temple
with his shadow. And as the sun sets
behind her temple in the afternoon, it perfectly bathes
his temple with her shadow. After 1,300 years, these two lovers
still touch and kiss from their tomb. 01:24Around the world, people love. They sing for love, they dance for love, they compose poems and stories about love. They tell myths and legends about love. They pine for love, they live for love,
they kill for love, and they die for love. As Walt Whitman once said,
""O I would stake all for you."" Anthropologists have found evidence
of romantic love in 170 societies. They've never found a society
that did not have it. 01:54But love isn't always a happy experience. In one study of college students,
they asked a lot of questions about love, but the two that stood out
to me the most were: ""Have you ever been rejected
by somebody who you really loved?"" And the second question was: ""Have you ever dumped somebody
who really loved you?"" And almost 95 percent of both men
and women said yes to both. Almost nobody gets out of love alive. 02:22So, before I start telling you
about the brain, I want to read for you what I think is the most powerful
love poem on Earth. There's other love poems that are,
of course, just as good, but I don't think this one
can be surpassed. It was told by an anonymous
Kwakiutl Indian of southern Alaska to a missionary in 1896. And here it is. I've never had the opportunity
to say it before. ""Fire runs through my body
with the pain of loving you. Pain runs through my body
with the fires of my love for you. Pain like a boil about to burst
with my love for you, consumed by fire with my love for you. I remember what you said to me. I am thinking of your love for me. I am torn by your love for me. Pain and more pain -- where are you going with my love? I am told you will go from here. I am told you will leave me here. My body is numb with grief. Remember what I said, my love. Goodbye, my love, goodbye."" Emily Dickinson once wrote,
""Parting is all we need to know of hell."" How many people have suffered in all the millions of years
of human evolution? How many people around the world are dancing with elation
at this very minute? Romantic love is one of the most powerful
sensations on Earth. 03:48So, several years ago,
I decided to look into the brain and study this madness. Our first study of people
who were happily in love has been widely publicized, so I'm only going to say
very little about it. We found activity in a tiny,
little factory near the base of the brain called the ventral tegmental area. We found activity in some cells
called the A10 cells, cells that actually make
dopamine, a natural stimulant, and spray it to many brain regions. Indeed, this part, the VTA,
is part of the brain's reward system. It's way below your cognitive
thinking process. It's below your emotions. It's part of what we call
the reptilian core of the brain, associated with wanting, with motivation,
with focus and with craving. In fact, the same brain region
where we found activity becomes active also
when you feel the rush of cocaine. 04:39But romantic love is much more
than a cocaine high -- at least you come down from cocaine. Romantic love is an obsession,
it possesses you. You lose your sense of self. You can't stop thinking
about another human being. Somebody is camping in your head. As an eighth-century Japanese poet said,
""My longing had no time when it ceases."" Wild is love. And the obsession can get worse
when you've been rejected. 05:08So, right now, Lucy Brown and I,
the neuroscientists on our project, are looking at the data of the people who were put into the machine
after they had just been dumped. It was very difficult actually,
putting these people in the machine, because they were in such bad shape. 05:23(Laughter) 05:27So anyway, we found activity
in three brain regions. We found activity in the brain region, in exactly the same brain region
associated with intense romantic love. What a bad deal. You know, when you've been dumped, the one thing you love to do
is just forget about this human being, and then go on with your life --
but no, you just love them harder. As the poet Terence,
the Roman poet once said, he said, ""The less my hope,
the hotter my love."" And indeed, we now know why. Two thousand years later,
we can explain this in the brain. That brain system -- the reward system for wanting, for motivation,
for craving, for focus -- becomes more active
when you can't get what you want. In this case, life's greatest prize:
an appropriate mating partner. 06:14We found activity
in other brain regions also -- in a brain region associated
with calculating gains and losses. You're lying there,
you're looking at the picture, and you're in this machine, and you're calculating what went wrong. What have I lost? As a matter of fact, Lucy and I
have a little joke about this. It comes from a David Mamet play, and there's two con artists in the play, and the woman is conning the man, and the man looks at the woman and says, ""Oh, you're a bad pony,
I'm not going to bet on you."" And indeed, it's this part of the brain, the core of the nucleus accumbens, that is becoming active
as you're measuring your gains and losses. It's also the brain region
that becomes active when you're willing to take enormous risks
for huge gains and huge losses. 07:03Last but not least,
we found activity in a brain region associated with deep attachment
to another individual. No wonder people suffer around the world,
and we have so many crimes of passion. When you've been rejected in love, not only are you engulfed
with feelings of romantic love, but you're feeling deep
attachment to this individual. Moreover, this brain circuit
for reward is working, and you're feeling intense energy,
intense focus, intense motivation and the willingness to risk it all,
to win life's greatest prize. 07:41So, what have I learned
from this experiment that I would like to tell the world? Foremost, I have come to think that romantic love is a drive,
a basic mating drive. Not the sex drive -- the sex drive gets you looking
for a whole range of partners. Romantic love enables you
to focus your mating energy on just one at a time,
conserve your mating energy, and start the mating process
with this single individual. I think of all the poetry
that I've read about romantic love, what sums it up best
is something that is said by Plato over 2,000 years ago. He said, ""The god of love
lives in a state of need. It is a need, it is an urge,
it is a homeostatic imbalance. Like hunger and thirst,
it's almost impossible to stamp out."" I've also come to believe
that romantic love is an addiction: a perfectly wonderful addiction
when it's going well, and a perfectly horrible addiction
when it's going poorly. 08:38And indeed, it has all
of the characteristics of addiction. You focus on the person,
you obsessively think about them, you crave them, you distort reality, your willingness to take enormous
risks to win this person. And it's got the three main
characteristics of addiction: tolerance, you need to see them
more, and more, and more; withdrawals; and last: relapse. I've got a girlfriend who's just
getting over a terrible love affair. It's been about eight months,
she's beginning to feel better. And she was driving along
in her car the other day, and suddenly she heard a song
on the car radio that reminded her of this man. Not only did the instant
craving come back, but she had to pull over
from the side of the road and cry. So, one thing I would like
the medical community, and the legal community,
and even the college community, to see if they can understand,
that indeed, romantic love is one of the most addictive
substances on Earth. 09:30I would also like to tell the world
that animals love. There's not an animal on this planet that will copulate with anything
that comes along. Too old, too young, too scruffy,
too stupid, and they won't do it. Unless you're stuck
in a laboratory cage -- and you know, if you spend
your entire life in a little box, you're not going to be as picky
about who you have sex with, but I've looked in a hundred species, and everywhere in the wild,
animals have favorites. As a matter of fact,
ethologists know this. There are over eight words
for what they call ""animal favoritism:"" selective proceptivity, mate choice,
female choice, sexual choice. And indeed, there are now
three academic articles in which they've looked
at this attraction, which may only last for a second, but it's a definite attraction, and either this same brain region,
this reward system, or the chemicals of that reward
system are involved. In fact, I think animal attraction
can be instant -- you can see an elephant
instantly go for another elephant. And I think that this is really the origin of what you and I call
""love at first sight."" 10:38People have often asked me whether what I know about love
has spoiled it for me. And I just simply say, ""Hardly."" You can know every single ingredient
in a piece of chocolate cake, and then when you sit down
and eat that cake, you can still feel that joy. And certainly, I make all the same
mistakes that everybody else does too, but it's really deepened my understanding and compassion, really,
for all human life. As a matter of fact, in New York,
I often catch myself looking in baby carriages
and feeling a little sorry for the tot. And in fact, sometimes
I feel a little sorry for the chicken on my dinner plate, when I think of how intense
this brain system is. Our newest experiment has been hatched by my colleague, Art Aron -- putting people who are reporting
that they are still in love, in a long-term relationship,
into the functional MRI. We've put five people in so far, and indeed, we found exactly
the same thing. They're not lying. The brain areas associated
with intense romantic love still become active, 25 years later. 11:54There are still many questions
to be answered and asked about romantic love. The question that I'm working on
right this minute -- and I'm only going to say it
for a second, and then end -- is, why do you fall in love
with one person, rather than another? I never would have
even thought to think of this, but Match.com, the Internet dating site, came to me three years ago
and asked me that question. And I said, I don't know. I know what happens in the brain,
when you do become in love, but I don't know why you fall in love
with one person rather than another. And so, I've spent
the last three years on this. And there are many reasons
that you fall in love with one person rather than another,
that psychologists can tell you. And we tend to fall in love with somebody
from the same socioeconomic background, the same general level of intelligence,
of good looks, the same religious values. Your childhood certainly plays a role,
but nobody knows how. And that's about it, that's all they know. No, they've never found the way two personalities
fit together to make a good relationship. 12:51So, it began to occur to me that maybe your biology pulls you
towards some people rather than another. And I have concocted a questionnaire
to see to what degree you express dopamine, serotonin,
estrogen and testosterone. I think we've evolved four
very broad personality types associated with the ratios
of these four chemicals in the brain. And on this dating site
that I have created, called Chemistry.com, I ask you first a series of questions to see to what degree
you express these chemicals, and I'm watching who chooses who to love. And 3.7 million people have taken
the questionnaire in America. About 600,000 people have taken it
in 33 other countries. I'm putting the data together now, and at some point --
there will always be magic to love, but I think I will come closer
to understanding why it is you can walk into a room
and everybody is from your background, your same general level
of intelligence, good looks, and you don't feel
pulled towards all of them. I think there's biology to that. I think we're going to end up,
in the next few years, to understand all kinds
of brain mechanisms that pull us to one person
rather than another. 14:06So, I will close with this. These are my older people. Faulkner said, ""The past is not dead,
it's not even past."" Indeed, we carry a lot of luggage
from our yesteryear in the human brain. And so, there's one thing that makes me
pursue my understanding of human nature, and this reminds me of it. These are two women. Women tend to get intimacy
differently than men do. Women get intimacy
from face-to-face talking. We swivel towards each other, we do what we call
the ""anchoring gaze"" and we talk. This is intimacy to women. I think it comes from millions of years of holding that baby
in front of your face, cajoling it, reprimanding it,
educating it with words. Men tend to get intimacy
from side-by-side doing. As soon as one guy looks up,
the other guy will look away. 15:00(Laughter) 15:02I think it comes from millions of years
sitting behind the bush, looking straight ahead, trying to hit
that buffalo on the head with a rock. I think, for millions of years,
men faced their enemies, they sat side-by-side with friends. So my final statement is: love is in us. It's deeply embedded in the brain. Our challenge is to understand each other. 15:27Thank you. 15:28(Applause) "

Hope so. I have no idea if you're seeing this, but I'm just going to look ahead
and trust that you're there. I've drawn a semicircle
in the sand in front of me so I don't walk past it
and look like I'm floating in midair. 00:26footnotefootnoteRight now I'm standing in the open air, on a beach under a palm tree, in the exact spot
where your stage used to be. I have 12 minutes with you. I set a limit. My wife Navid once said that infinite possibility
is a creator's worst enemy. For example, this dress: I'd asked
her to design something that a priest might have worn
in 23rd-century Cairo. But we only had three days to make it, and the only fabric we had was an old duvet cover
that another resident left behind. But she did it, and it's perfect. And she looked at it and said, ""Proof of concept --
creation needs constraint."" So with these 12 minutes, I'm going to tell you
about my greatest discovery. 01:24footnotefootnoteFor my whole life, my obsession
has been eternal life, as I know it is so many of yours. You may be happy to know
that your research will pay off. I am 318 years old. The average human lifespan
is now 432 years, and my work has been to extend
the human lifespan indefinitely. And I've never questioned that someday, we'll reach a point
where we'll be content. But the opposite keeps happening: the longer we live,
the longer we want to live, the less we want to die. 02:03Who can blame us? The universe is so big. There won't ever not be more to see. Just yesterday, I was reading about how you can
take out a boat on Europa and sail from island to island
all over the planet, and some of the islands have villages
that you can stay and visit and sleep under the shadow of Jupiter. And then there's this other island
where there's just one songwriter who sits and plays mandolin for the ocean. And then there are others
where there's no one and there never has been, and so you go just for the pleasure
of touching your foot to sand that no foot has ever touched before. You could spend 400 years doing just that. 02:51footnotefootnoteRight now the Moon is rising
in the Northeast. I can see the cities on it
with my naked eye. They're connected like nerve clusters: Mariapolis on the South Pole,
and Ramachandran on the Equator. And New Tehran in the Sea of Tranquility. 03:12footnotefootnoteThat's where Navid and I met. We were both artists downtown. The day we met, we were passing
each other in Azadi Square, and we bumped shoulders. And I turned to apologize and she, without saying hello
or introducing herself or anything, said, ""Well, why do you think
we didn't just pass through each other?"" And first of all, I thought,
""Who the hell are you?"" But second, the question annoyed me, because the answer is so simple. I said, ""We didn't pass through each other because elementary particles have mass and because the space
between elementary particles is filled with the binding energy
that also has the properties of mass, and we've known that for 800 years."" She must have been in one of those moods where she likes to mess with strangers. Or maybe she was just flirting with me, because she looked at me and said,
""I thought you'd say that. Think deeper."" And then she took off her belt, this belt that I'm wearing now, and she said, ""Our universe is built
so that particles have mass. Without that basic constraint, we'd have just passed right through
each other at the speed of light and never even known."" 04:36And that's how our romance began. Navid and I never ran out of things to talk about. Never. It was incredible. It was like we were both heroes
climbing up into a mountain range together and we kept arriving at new vistas, and these new, perfect
constellations of words would come out of us to describe them. And we'd forget them
as soon as we made them, and throw them over our shoulder
and go on to the next thing, on and up. Or one time, Navid said that our talk
was like we were always making bread, and that we were always
adding in a little more flour and a little more water, and folding it in and turning it over and never getting around to baking it. 05:32footnotefootnoteIf my obsession was eternal life,
Navid's obsession was touch. She had a genius for it. All of her work revolved around it. My body was like a canvas for her, and she would draw her fingertip
down over my face so slowly that I couldn't feel it moving. And she was obsessed with the exact moment when I would stop being able to tell
the difference between her body and mine. Or she would just lie across me
and dig her shoulder into mine and say, ""Pilar, why does
this feel so good?"" I'd say, ""I don't know!"" And she always had a facetious answer
for her facetious question, but the answer I remember today is, ""It feels good because the universe chose
its constraints, and we are its art."" 06:41It's always funny what you think
the future is going to be like versus what it turns out to be. In your time, scientists thought
humans could freeze themselves and wake up in the future. And they did -- but then they died. In your time, scientists thought
humans could replace organs and extend life for hundreds of years. And they did, but eventually, they died anyway. In your time, Earth
is the only place people live. In my time, Earth is the place
people come to die. 07:25footnotefootnoteSo when Navid started to show the signs, our friends assumed I would do
what everyone does, which is say goodbye
and send her to Earth, so that none of us
would have to look at her or be around her
or think about her and her ... failure to keep living. More than anything, they didn't want to be around
her actual physical body. They kept referring to it as ""declining,"" even though she herself
was fascinated by it, the changes it was going through, following the rules of its nature
day by day, independent of her will. I did send Navid to Earth. But I came with her. I remember a friend of ours,
just before we left, said, ""I just think it's arrogant, like the rules don't apply to you,
like you think your love is that special."" But I did. 08:32So, even here on Earth, I kept working on how to extend life. It didn't occur to me that there could be any other response. I kept going back to that thing
that Navid said to me that day in Azadi Square, that without that basic constraint -- a universe that granted mass to matter -- we would not exist. That's one rule. Another rule is that all mass
is subject to entropy. And there is no way to be
in this universe without mass. I know. I tried everything. I tried creating a photon box
where the Higgs field was altered. I tried recording all
subatomic movements in my body and replaying them on closed loop. Nothing worked. 09:21But my final innovation
was to create a coil dimension with the boundaries of a body
in which time moved infinitely slower, but whose projection would appear
to move in normal time. That body would then appear
in our universe as a hologram -- here but not here. When I realized I'd done it, I ran to her room, so happy to tell her I'd done it, moving through space
almost normally to all eyes, even to my own, and went to lie down next to her, and forgot, and fell right through her. I'd found a way to eternal life, at the expense of the one thing
Navid loved most, which was to touch and be touched. And she threw me out. I still got to watch, though. 10:39Humans live 400 years now, and we still die. And when death comes, the dying still pick at their bedsheets, and their arms break out
in blue and violet blooms on the insides, and their breaths get further
and further apart, like they're falling asleep. 11:09I've always thought that what gives a life meaning is adventure. And death is just a problem we haven't discovered the solution to yet. But maybe a life has meaning
only because it ends. Maybe that's the paradox: constraints don't constrain,
they allow perfect freedom. 11:39(Sighs) 11:45There was a thunderstorm
here this morning. There is another forecast for tonight, but for now the sky is clear. I can't feel the wind here, but I just asked one of the caretakers
who passed by what it felt like, and she said it felt warm,
like melted butter. An answer worthy of my wife. I have to find my way back to the flesh. Until then, I take up no space
but the space you give me. "
3,Rethinking thinking,Trevor Maber,Sep 2018,"Every day, we meet people and process our interactions-- making inferences and developing beliefs about the world around us. In this lesson, Trevor Maber introduces us to the idea of a 'ladder of inference' and a process for rethinking the way we interact. [Directed by Biljana Labovic, narrated by Trevor Maber].", (24K),"Transcript (21 Languages)DeutschEnglishEspañolFrançaisItalianoMagyarPolskiPortuguês brasileiroPortuguês de PortugalRomânăTiếng ViệtTürkçeРусскийՀայրենעבריתالعربيةفارسى中文 (简体)中文 (繁體)日本語한국어Tom Carter, TranslatorBedirhan Cinar, Reviewer00:14Imagine a microscopic-sized ladder
contained in the part of our brain that we'll label our subconscious. The Ladder of Inference, which was first proposed
by Harvard professor Chris Argyris, is the basis of this model. Every time we interact with someone, that experience
enters the ladder at the bottom. That same experience zips up
the ladder in the blink of an eye, exiting at the top. This process happens
thousands of times a day without us knowing it. Let's focus on what happens
on each rung of the ladder. On the first rung, we have the raw data
and observations of our experience. This is very similar to what someone
watching a video recording of our experience would see. Moving up to the second rung, we filter in specific information
and details from our experience. We unknowingly filter
based on our preferences, tendencies, and many other aspects
that we believe are important. On to the third rung. We assign meaning to the information
we have filtered through. This is where we start to interpret
what our information is telling us. On our fourth rung,
a very crucial thing happens. We develop assumptions based on the meaning
we created on the previous rung, and we start to blur the distinction
between what is fact and what is story. On the fifth rung, we develop conclusions
based on our assumptions. This is also where
our emotional reactions are created. On the sixth rung, we adjust our beliefs
about the world around us, including the person or people involved in our experience of the moment. On the seventh and final rung, we take action
based on our adjusted beliefs. Still with me? Great! Let's take a real-life example and run it up the ladder
to see how this all works. Have you ever been cut off
in a parking lot, signal light on as you steer toward your coveted spot, only to slam on your brakes
at the last minute as someone pulls in front of you
and steals your spot away? Imagine that experience
and notice all of the data and observations landing
on the first rung of your ladder. Now let's watch what we pay attention to
on the second rung. Who cares that it's sunny out
and the birds are chirping? The 50% off sign outside
of your favorite store is meaningless. You filter in the sensation
of your grip tightening on the wheel, you feel your blood pressure rise, you hear the squeal of your brakes, and you notice the expression
on the face of the other driver as he pulls in front of you
and quickly looks away. Time for our third rung. Ever since you were young, your parents taught you
the importance of waiting in line and taking your turn. You live and die by the rule
of first come, first served. And now this guy
has just stolen your spot. What gives? Up to the fourth rung we go. Watch closely as our assumptions take over and our story creates itself. ""That stupid jerk, didn't his parents
teach him anything? How could he not see my signal light? He must never pay attention! Why does he think he's more important
than anyone else?"" Jumping quickly to the fifth rung, we conclude that this guy
is heartless, inconsiderate, he needs to be taught a lesson
and put in his place. We feel angry, frustrated,
vindictive, justified. On our sixth rung, we adjust our beliefs
based on the experience. ""That's the last time I give in! Next time someone tries to cut me off, tires will be smoking on the pavement as I squeal past them into my spot."" And finally our last rung: we take action. We back up, pull up behind his car, honk our horn, and roll down our window to scream a few choice words as well. Now imagine, he walks over quickly, apologizing. His wife, who's almost due
with their first baby, called him from inside the mall
to say she is in labor and needs to get
to the hospital immediately. We're momentarily shocked,
apologize profusely, and wish him luck
as he rushes toward the entrance. What just happened here? What changed? Why is this so significant? In our parking lot example, our beliefs were short-circuited
by the ladder of the other individual. ""My wife is in labor,
I need to get there quick, there's a parking spot. Whew! Oh, jeez, I cut someone off. I'd better apologize quickly
so they don't think I'm a jerk."" But what if we were able
to short-circuit our ladders ourselves? Proactively, by choice? Guess what? We can! Let's return to our unique
human function of free will. Next time you notice yourself
reacting to your experience, pay focused attention to your ladder. Ask yourself what beliefs are at play, where do they come from? What data and observations
did you filter in as a result of your beliefs, and why? Are your assumptions valid
and supported by facts? Would a different set of assumptions
create different feelings, and result in new and better
conclusions and actions? We all have our own unique ladder. Be mindful of yours, and help others to see theirs. "
3,The necessity of normalizing queer love,Panti Bliss,Jun 2020,The public displays of affection that straight couples take for granted every day can be outright dangerous for queer couples to practice -- what do you do when simply holding hands with a loved one can be considered a political act? Irish activist Panti Bliss shares what it's like to navigate such a world and highlights the importance of normalizing queer love in public spaces., (16K),"Transcript (8 Languages)DeutschEnglishFrançaisPortuguês brasileiroČeštinaСрпски, Srpskiالعربية日本語Liam Regan, TranslatorDenise RQ, Reviewer00:08Hi! Hi! I am forty-five years old. I know I look amazing, thank you.
(Laughter) I am forty-five years old and I have never once unselfconsciously held hands
with a lover in public. I am forty-five years old
and I have never once casually, comfortably, carelessly
held hands with a partner in public. I don't know how many of you
can even imagine what that might be like because, of course,
it's a small thing, isn't it, holding hands with a lover in public? And it's not that nobody wanted to,
it's just that we didn't feel comfortable. Now, like many gay people,
when I was younger, in my young life, I struggled at one time against being gay. I didn't want to be different. I didn't want to be this thing
that I didn't really understand. This thing that I had learned
was shameful or jokeworthy. But when I eventually did
sort of understand and come to accept who and what I am, I have never since that moment, never once, have I ever wished
that it turned out differently! I am thoroughly, deeply, delightedly,
happy to be gay! (Applause) It suits me! (Laughter)
I am really good at it! (Laughter) And yet, everyday
I am jealous of straight people, because that private, little, small,
intimate gesture of affection has never once been mine. Everyday I see young, straight couples
walking through the park and they are casually holding hands
and I am jealous of them! I see a teenage couple at a bus stop and she is leaning into him,
and her hand is in his, and both of their hands are
tucked into his jacket pocket for warmth, and I am jealous of that teenage couple! I will sometimes see a man
who unconsciously put his hand, a protective arm,
around his girlfriend and she'll link her fingers through his,
and I am jealous of that! Maybe you're on Grafton Street
and you see an older lady and she gestures to draw
her husband's attention to something in the window, and without even thinking
he just takes her hand and they stand there
peering into the window discussing whatever it is
that drew their attention and their hands are
just carelessly joined together, and I am jealous of that! Because gay people do not
get to hold hands in public without first considering the risk. Gay people do not get to put an arm
through another arm or put a hand on a boyfriend's waist
without first considering what the possible
consequences might be. We look around to see:
where are we, who's around, is it late at night?
What kind of area is it? Are there bored teenagers
hanging around looking for amusement? Are there bunches of lads
standing outside a pub? And if we decided OK,
maybe it is, it's OK, well then we do hold hands, but the thing is that now those hands
are not casual and thoughtless. They are now
considered and weighed. But we stroll on hand in hand
trying to be just normal and carefree just like everybody else,
but actually we're not! Because we are constantly scanning
the pavement ahead, just in case. And then even if we do see, you know,
a group of blokes coming towards us, maybe we will decide sort of silently
to continue holding hands, defiantly! But now our small, intimate gesture
between two people in love is no longer a small, intimate gesture. It is a political act of defiance,
and it has been ruined. And anyway then you sort of think: ""Well, we've had such a lovely afternoon
poking around in that garden center looking at things for the garden
we don't actually have."" (Laughter) And then you think, all it will take
is one spat ""faggots"" or a split lip to turn that really lovely afternoon
into a bad afternoon that you will never want to remember. And even if you are somewhere
where you think: ""Ah, it's perfectly fine here. Nobody here is going to react badly
to our tiny gesture."" You know, I don't know, say you're
wandering through a posh department store. Even then people will notice. Now, they may only notice
because they're thinking: ""Isn't nice to see two gays
holding hands in public?"" But they still notice, and I don't want them to notice because then our small, intimate,
private, little, human gesture has been turned into a statement,
and I don't want that! Our little, private, gesture,
like Schrödinger's cat, is altered simply by being observed. We live in this sort of homophobic world, and you might think that a small, little thing
like holding hands in public, ""Well, it's just a small thing,""
and you're right! It is indeed just a small thing. But it is one of many small things
that make us human, and there are lots of small things everyday that LGBT people
have to put up with, that other people
don't have to put up with. Lots of small things
that we have to put up with in order to be safe or not to be
the object of ridicule or scorn. And we are expected
to put up with those things and just thank our blessings
that we don't live in a country where we could be imprisoned
or executed for being gay. And we are so used to making
those small adjustments everyday, that even now we rarely ourselves
even notice that we are doing it, because it is just part
of the background of our lives. This constant malign presence
that we have assimilated, and if we complain about it, we are told
we have nothing to complain about because: ""Aren't you lucky
that you don't live in Uganda?"" And yes, I am lucky
that I don't live in Uganda, but that's not good enough! This isn't some sort of game
or competition where the person who has it the worst
wins the right to complain and everybody else has to just
put up or shut up. Our society is homophobic! It is infused with homophobia. It is dripping with homophobia. And when you are forty-five years old and
you have spent thirty years putting up, thirty years absorbing
all of those small slights and intimidations and sneers
and occasionally much worse, you just get tired of it. You get fed up putting up. I am fed up of reading yet another article
by yet another straight person explaining why I am less somehow
than everybody else. You get fed up listening to people
describe you as intrinsically disordered, people who don't even know you,
from their celibate pulpits. You get fed up of the scrawled graffiti, and you get fed up of people
sneeringly describe things as gay. You get fed up of steeling yourself
to pass by the Saturday night drunks hoping that they won't notice you, and you get fed up of people
using their time and energies and talents to campaign against you being treated
just like every other citizen. (Applause) I'm forty-five
and I'm fed up putting up. Now I would, of course, prefer if nobody
harbored any animosity towards gay people or any discomfort with gay relationships, but, you know, I can live with the kind of
small, personal, private homophobia that some people might have. For example,
I can live with Mary in Wicklow who sometimes turns on the television
and sees Graham Norton and thinks, ""Oh, he seems nice enough
but does he have to be so gay?"" (Laughter) I can live with that. I can live with Mary who doesn't
know any gay people, apart from that fella who does her hair
once a month in ""Curl Up and Dye"". (Laughter) Mary, whose only knowledge of gay people
and our relationships comes from what she has gleaned from
schoolyards, church and Coronation Street. I can live with that. I would be happy to sit down on the sofa
and watch Coronation Street with Mary. I would be happy to have a cup of tea
with her and discuss with her why she feels a little uncomfortable
with gay relationships and I would hope that
Mary would change her mind. I would hope that she would
meet more gay people and find out pretty quickly that
we are just as ordinary, just as nice or just as annoying
as all of you people are. And I would hope that
she would change her mind for her own sake
as much as anybody else's, because gay people are just as capable of bringing goodness into Mary's life
as anybody else. And, of course, we could
help her with the decorating! (Laughter) But that kind of personal discomfort
with gay people and their relationships is entirely different from the kind of homophobia
that manifests itself in public. The kind of homophobia that manifests itself in an attempt
to have LGBT people treated differently or less than everybody else. The kind of homophobia that
seeks to characterize gay people and their relationships
as less worthy of respect. That kind of homophobia
I do have a problem with, and I think gay people should be allowed
to call it when they see it, because it is our right to do so! Of course, many people
object to the word homophobia itself. They object to the ""phobia"" part. 'I'm not afraid of you,"" they say. (Laughter) But I'm not saying that homophobes cower in fear every time
they pass a Cher album, (Laughter) but they are afraid. They are afraid of what the world
will look like when it treats gay, lesbian
and bisexual people with the same respect as everybody else. They are afraid that they won't fit
in this brave new world of equality. But, of course, their fear is irrational because, of course, the world
will not look any different. Kids will still want to eat ice cream,
dogs will still play fetch, the tide will still come in, and parallel parking
will still be difficult. (Laughter) The most vocal homophobes
who know that they long ago lost the arguments around
the decriminalization of homosexual sex or every other advance
for gay people since. These days you will find
those very vocal homophobes clustered around
the same-sex marriage debate -- and it is quite the spectacle because, of course, they know that they can't just come right out
and bluntly say what drives them, which is an animus towards gay people, and a disgust at what
they imagine we do in bed, because they know that that won't wash
with the general public anymore. So they are forced to sort of scramble
for any other reason that they can think of
to argue their case. So, gay people are going to destroy
the institution of marriage, gay couples will be wandering through
orphanages picking babies off shelves trying to find one that matches
their new IKEA sofa. (Laughter) Or that allowing gay people to get
married will destroy society itself, and many, many more including
my own personal favorite, which is the old argument that the word
""marriage"" is defined in some dictionary as a union between a man and a woman, and that therefore same-sex marriage
can't possibly be a ""marriage"". Which is a piffling argument against
words and dictionaries and not an argument against
same-sex marriage. (Applause) Now, of course, the other real driver
of homophobia, and you can all clutch your pearls here
because I am going to go here, is a disgust with gay sex,
in particular with gay male sex. The poor old lesbians just get caught
in the homophobic crossfire. (Laughter) You know guilty by association. Because what they really
don't like is anal sex, sodomy, you know, buggery, and they assume that that is all we do. They feverishly imagine that we spend all
day jumping around buggering each other. I mean they obsess on it, and, in fact,
what they actually do, is reduce us down to this one sex act,
whether or not we do it at all, because we are not regular people
with the same hopes and aspirations and ambitions and feelings
as everyone else, we are simply walking sex acts. Earlier this year I was invited
to take part in the St. Pat's for All parade
in Queens, New York. Now it is a really lovely, charming,
grassroots event in Queens which was set up in response to
the ban on gay groups marching in the famous Manhattan
St. Patrick's Day Parade. In that Manhattan St. Patrick's Day Parade
any Irish group who wants can march, Irish policemen can march,
Irish firemen, Irish footballers, Irish community groups,
Irish volleyball teams, Irish book clubs. Any Irish people who want
to have a good shot at being allowed to march
in that parade -- except for Irish gays, because, as far as the organizers
of that parade are concerned, gays are nothing more
than walking sex acts, and there is no place for buggery
in their parade. Now, I actually saw
a small documentary once about one of the leaders of
the organizers of that parade, they are the Ancient Order of Hibernians, and they're like
a Catholic Orange Order (Laughter) -- they dress the same and everything -- (Laughter) and in the documentary, you know,
he was a nice old fellow, and he had this lovely wife,
and they seemed very happy together. And when I looked at them,
I saw this life lived together, and I imagined if I asked him
about their life together, that he would remember
the first time they met, he would remember how nervous he was
on their first date together, and how proud he was when he turned
and saw her coming up the aisle in that dress that she had
fretted over for so long. And I imagine that if I asked him, he would remember that phone call
to say that she had gone into labor and the dash across town, and the other time when she
went so far past her due date that she promised she would bounce up
and down on a trampoline until the baby bounced out of her
and how they laughed so hard about that. And I imagine he would
remember other occasions like when their youngest broke his arm
and cried all the way to the hospital, and that other time when she was sick and
he could not sleep alone in the empty bed and so in the middle of the night he
got up and went back to the hospital even though he knew they wouldn't
let him in to see her at that hour. I imagine that he would remember all
of those things and many more. All of the small things that go up
to making a relationship and making a person a person. And when I looked at him,
I imagined all of those things too. But when he looks at me
he doesn't see me that way. He doesn't see gay people that way. To him we are just sex acts and there
is no place for sex acts in his parade. I am forty-five years old
and I am fed up putting up. So, I'm not anymore. I'm forty-five years old
and I am not putting up anymore because I don't have the energy anymore. Putting up is exhausting! I am forty-five years old
and I'm not putting up anymore because I don't have
the patience anymore. Forty-five years old! I was born
six months before the Stonewall riots, and you have had
forty-five years to work out, that despite appearances, I am just as ordinary,
just as unremarkable, and just as human as you are! I'm forty-five years old
and I am not asking anymore I am just being -- human being! Thank you for your time! (Applause) Thank you! Thank you! (Applause) "
3,The lost art of letter-writing,Lakshmi Pratury,Dec 2007,"Lakshmi Pratury remembers the lost art of letter-writing and shares a series of notes her father wrote to her before he died. Her short but heartfelt talk may inspire you to set pen to paper, too.", (24K),"Transcript (44 Languages)Bahasa IndonesiaCrnogorskiDeutschEnglishEspañolEsperantoFrançaisHrvatskiItalianoLatviešuMagyarNederlandsPolskiPortuguês brasileiroPortuguês de PortugalRomânăShqipSlovenčinaSuomiTiếng ViệtTürkçeČeštinaΕλληνικάРусскийСрпски, SrpskiУкраїнськабългарскимакедонскиעבריתالعربيةاُردُوفارسىکوردی سۆرانیکورمانجیमराठीहिन्दीગુજરાતીภาษาไทยབོད་སྐད་မြန်မာဘာသာ中文 (简体)中文 (繁體)日本語한국어00:00So I thought, ""I will talk about death."" Seemed to be the passion today. Actually, it's not about death. It's inevitable, terrible, but really what I want to talk about is, I'm just fascinated by the legacy people leave when they die. That's what I want to talk about. 00:14So Art Buchwald left his legacy of humor with a video that appeared soon after he died, saying, ""Hi! I'm Art Buchwald, and I just died."" And Mike, who I met at Galapagos, a trip which I won at TED, is leaving notes on cyberspace where he is chronicling his journey through cancer. And my father left me a legacy of his handwriting through letters and a notebook. In the last two years of his life, when he was sick, he filled a notebook with his thoughts about me. He wrote about my strengths, weaknesses, and gentle suggestions for improvement, quoting specific incidents, and held a mirror to my life. 01:03After he died, I realized that no one writes to me anymore. Handwriting is a disappearing art. I'm all for email and thinking while typing, but why give up old habits for new? Why can't we have letter writing and email exchange in our lives? There are times when I want to trade all those years that I was too busy to sit with my dad and chat with him, and trade all those years for one hug. But too late. But that's when I take out his letters and I read them, and the paper that touched his hand is in mine, and I feel connected to him. 01:51So maybe we all need to leave our children with a value legacy, and not a financial one. A value for things with a personal touch -- an autographed book, a soul-searching letter. If a fraction of this powerful TED audience could be inspired to buy a beautiful paper -- John, it'll be a recycled one -- and write a beautiful letter to someone they love, we actually may start a revolution where our children may go to penmanship classes. 02:21So what do I plan to leave for my son? I collect autographed books, and those of you authors in the audience know I hound you for them -- and CDs too, Tracy. I plan to publish my own notebook. As I witnessed my father's body being swallowed by fire, I sat by his funeral pyre and wrote. I have no idea how I'm going to do it, but I am committed to compiling his thoughts and mine into a book, and leave that published book for my son. 02:52I'd like to end with a few verses of what I wrote at my father's cremation. And those linguists, please pardon the grammar, because I've not looked at it in the last 10 years. I took it out for the first time to come here. ""Picture in a frame, ashes in a bottle, boundless energy confined in the bottle, forcing me to deal with reality, forcing me to deal with being grown up. I hear you and I know that you would want me to be strong, but right now, I am being sucked down, surrounded and suffocated by these raging emotional waters, craving to cleanse my soul, trying to emerge on a firm footing one more time, to keep on fighting and flourishing just as you taught me. Your encouraging whispers in my whirlpool of despair, holding me and heaving me to shores of sanity, to live again and to love again."" Thank you. "
3,A love story about the power of art as organizing,Aja Monet and phillip agnew,Feb 2019,"In a lyrical talk full of radical imagination, poet Aja Monet and community organizer phillip agnew share the story of how they fell in love and what they've learned about the powerful connection between great social movements and meaningful art. Journey to Smoke Signals Studio in Miami, their home and community art space where they're creating a refuge for neighbors and creators -- and imagining a new answer to distraction, anger and anxiety.", (99K),"Transcript (12 Languages)EnglishEspañolFrançaisItalianoPortuguês brasileiroPortuguês de PortugalTürkçeРусскийالعربية中文 (简体)中文 (繁體)한국어FootnotesFootnotes00:01Aja Monet: Our story begins
like all great, young love stories. 00:05Phillip Agnew: She slid in my DMs ... 00:07AM: He liked about 50 of my photos, back-to-back,
in the middle of the night -- 00:11PA: What I saw was an artist
committed to truth and justice -- and she's beautiful, but I digress. 00:18AM: Our story actually begins
across many worlds, over maqluba and red wine in Palestine. But how did we get there? 00:27PA: Well, I was born in Chicago, the son of a preacher and a teacher. My ears first rung with church songs
sung by my mother on Saturday mornings. My father's South Side
sermons summoned me. My first words
were more notes than quotes. It was music that molded me. Later on, it was Florida A&amp;M University
that first introduced me to organizing. In 2012, a young black male
named Trayvon Martin was murdered, and it changed my life
and millions of others'. We were a ragtag group
of college kids and not-quite adults who had decided enough was enough. Art and organizing became our answer
to anger and anxiety. We built a movement
and it traveled around the world and to Palestine, in 2015. 01:09AM: I was born to a single mother in the Pink House projects
of Brooklyn, New York. Maddened by survival, I gravitated inwards towards books, poems
and my brother's hand-me-down Walkman. I saw train-station theater, subwoofing streets and hood murals. In high school, I found a community
of metaphor magicians and truth-telling poets in an organization called Urban Word NYC. Adopted by the Black Arts movement, I won the legendary
Nuyorican Poets Cafe Grand Slam title. 01:40(Applause and cheers) 01:42At Sarah Lawrence College,
I worked with artists to respond to Hurricane Katrina
and the earthquake; I discovered the impact of poetry and the ability to not just
articulate our feelings, but to get us to work
towards changing things and doing something about it, when a friend, Maytha Alhassen,
invited me to Palestine ... 02:02PA: We were a delegation
of artists and organizers, and we immersed ourselves
in Palestinian culture, music, their stories. Late into the night, we would have discussions
about the role of art in politics and the role of politics in art. Aja and I disagree. 02:18AM: Oh, we disagree. 02:19PA: But we quite quickly
and unsurprisingly fell in love. Exhibit A: me working my magic. 02:26(Laughter) 02:28AM: Obvious, isn't it? Four months later, this artist -- 02:33PA: and this organizer -- 02:35AM: moved into a little home
with a big backyard, in Miami. 02:42PA: (Sighs) Listen, five months
before this ever happened, I predicted it all. I'm going to tell you -- a friend sat me down and said, ""You've done so much for organizing, when are you going to settle down?"" I looked him straight in the face and I said, ""The only way
that it would ever happen is if it is a collision. This woman would have to knock me
completely off course."" I didn't know how right I was. 03:04(Laughter) 03:05Our first few months
were like any between young lovers: filled with hot, passionate, all-night ... 03:12AM: nonstop ... 03:14PA: discussions. 03:15(Laughter) 03:16PA: Aja challenged everything
I knew and understood about the world. She forced me -- 03:21AM: lovingly -- 03:22PA: to see our organizing
work with new eyes. She helped me see the unseen things and how artists illuminate
our interior worlds. 03:29AM: There were many days
I did not want to get up out of bed and face the exterior world. I was discouraged. There was so much loss and death and artists were being used
to numb, lull and exploit. While winning awards, accolades
and grants soothed so many egos, people were still dying and I was seeking community. Meeting Phillip brought so much joy,
love, truth into my life, and it pulled me out of isolation. He showed me that community
and relationships wasn't just about building
great movements. It was integral in creating
powerful, meaningful art, and neither could be done in solitude. 04:14PA: Yeah, we realized many of our artist
and organizer friends were also lost in these cycles of sadness, and we were in movements
that often found themselves at funerals. We asked ourselves what becomes of a generation
all too familiar with the untimely ends of lives
streamed daily on our Timelines? It was during one
of our late-night discussions that we saw beyond art and organizing and began to see that art was organizing. 04:40AM: The idea was set: art was an anchor,
not an accessory to movement. Our home was a home
of radical imagination; an instrument of our nurturing hearts; a place of risk where were dared
to laugh, love, cry, debate. Art, books, records and all this stuff
decorated our walls, and there was lizards -- walls of palm trees that guided
our guests into our backyard, where our neighbors would come
and feel right at home. The wind -- the wind was an affirmation
for the people who walked into the space. And we learned that in a world -- a bewildering world
of so much distraction -- we were able to cultivate a space
where people could come and be present, and artists and organizers
could find refuge. 05:32PA: This became Smoke Signals Studio. 05:35AM: As we struggle to clothe, house,
feed and educate our communities; our spirits hunger for connection,
joy and purpose; and as our bodies
are out on the front lines, our souls still need to be fed, or else we succumb
to despair and depression. Our art possesses rhythmic communication, coded emotional cues, improvised feelings of critical thought. Our social movements should be like jazz: encouraging active participation, listening, spontaneity and freedom. What people see as a party ... 06:14PA: is actually a movement meeting. See, we aren't all protest and pain. Here's a place to be loved, to be felt, to be heard, and where we prepare
for the most pressing political issues in our neighborhoods. See, laws never change culture, but culture always changes laws. Art -- 06:36(Applause) 06:38footnotefootnoteArt as organizing is even changing
and opening doors in places seen as the opposite of freedom. Our weekly poetry series is transforming the lives of men
incarcerated at Dade Correctional, and we're so excited to bring you all
the published work of one of those men, Echo Martinez. In the intro, he says ... 06:55AM: ""Poetry for the people
is a sick pen's penicillin. It's a cuff key to a prisoner's dreams. The Molotov in the ink. It is knowledge, it is overstanding, it is tasting ingredients
in everything you've been force-fed, but most of all, it's a reminder
that we all have voices, we all can be heard
even if we have to scream."" 07:14In 2018, we created our first annual
Maroon Poetry Festival at the TACOLCY Center in Liberty City. There, the Last Poets,
Sonia Sanchez, Emory Douglas and the late, great Ntozake Shange, performed and met
with local artists and organizers. We were able to honor them for their commitment
to radical truth-telling. And in addition to that, we transformed a public park into the physical manifestation
of the world we are organizing for. Everything that we put into poetry, we put into the art, into the creativity, into the curated kids' games and into the stunning stage design. 07:57PA: Our work is in a long line
of cultural organizers that understood to use art
to animate a radical future. Artists like June Jordan, Emory Douglas and Nina Simone. They understood what many of us
are just now realizing -- that to get people to build the ship, you've got to get
them to long for the sea; that data rarely moves people,
but great art always does. This understanding -- 08:21(Applause) 08:24footnotefootnoteThis understanding informed the thinking behind the Dream Defenders'
""Freedom Papers,"" a radical political vision
for the future of Florida that talked about people over profits. Now, we could have done a policy paper. Instead, artists and organizers
came together in their poetry to create incredible murals and did the video that we see behind us. We joined the political precision
of the Black Panther Party and the beautiful poetry
of Puerto Rican poet Martín Espada to bring our political vision to life. 08:55AM: Now thousands of Floridians
across age, race, gender and class see the ""Freedom Papers""
as a vision for the future of their lives. For decades, our artists and our art
has been used to exploit, lull, numb, sell things to us and to displace our communities, but we believe
that the personal is political and the heart is measured by what is done, not what one feels. And so art as organizing is not
just concerned with artists' intentions, but their actual impact. Great art is not a monologue. Great art is a dialogue
between the artist and the people. 09:41PA: Four years ago, this artist ... 09:44AM: and this organizer ... 09:46PA: found that we were not just a match. 09:49AM: We were a mirror. 09:50PA: Our worlds truly did collide, and in many ways ... 09:54AM: they combined. 09:56PA: We learned so much about movement, about love and about art
at its most impactful: when it articulates the impossible
and when it erodes individualism, when it plays into the gray places
of our black and white worlds, when it does what our democracy does not, when it reminds us
that we are not islands, when it adorns every street
but Wall Street and Madison Avenue, when it reminds us that we are not islands and refuses to succumb to the numbness, when it indicts empire and inspires each
and every one of us to love, tell the truth and make revolution irresistible. 10:34AM: For the wizards -- 10:35(Applause) 10:39AM: For the wizards
and ways of our defiance, love-riot visions of our rising,
risen, raised selves. 10:49The overcoming grace -- fires, bitter tongues, wise as rickety rocking chairs, suffering salt and sand skies. 10:58Memories unshackled and shining stitches on a stretch-marked heart. 11:04For the flowers that bloom
in midnight scars. How we suffered and sought a North Star. When there was no light, we glowed. We sparked this rejoice, this righteous delight. We have a cause to take joy in. How we weathered and persisted, tenacious, no stone unturned. How we witnessed the horror of mankind and did not become
that which horrified us. 11:35PA: Thank you. 11:36AM: Thank you. 11:37(Applause) "

princess of Tara, and bride-to-be, was furious. Fionn Mac Cumhaill, leader of the Fianna, Ireland’s most celebrated band 
of warriors, had just arrived at her castle. Gráinne had believed she was betrothed
to a young soldier, bold and brilliant enough to be her equal. Yet upon their arrival, it became clear
she was expected to marry Fionn himself; who, while once a legend, 
was far past his prime. Gráinne would not suffer this insult. 00:40Before the wedding,
the King held a great banquet. As the warriors told tales of Fionn’s
strength and magical healing hands, Gráinne waited to enact her revenge. But while scanning the room, her eyes
locked on to one of the guests. Diarmuid, one of Fionn’s bravest soldiers and foster child 
of the God of Love himself, was renowned for his stunning beauty. Perhaps this was the bold warrior
the princess had imagined? Only one way to find out. 01:10Gráinne swept into action, slipping a sleeping draught 
into the partygoers’ goblets. Soon the hall fell silent—
save for two unenchanted guests. The pair immediately felt a powerful
connection. But Diarmuid hesitated. He’d never put his interests
before the Fianna’s. Seeing Diarmuid waver 
between duty and desire, Gráinne took the decision 
out of his hands. With a light kiss, 
she placed a geas on his brow— an ancient spell that bound them together,
for better or worse. 01:46As the pair escaped,
Diarmuid’s heart was racing. Had he really betrayed Fionn 
for a woman he’d just met? To answer his son’s questions, 
Angus Óg appeared beside them. The God of Love blessed their union
and eased his son’s concern. But he also warned that endless
difficulties lay ahead. 02:07At the palace, Fionn awoke full of wrath. He rallied an epic war band that quickly
caught up to the lovers. To buy time, Diarmuid and Gráinne conjured
a massive enclosure with seven doors. While Gráinne escaped with Angus Óg,
Diarmuid went door to door seeking Fionn. Some of the Fianna sought peaceful
surrender, others itched for combat. Diarmuid gave neither. But when he finally heard his leader’s 
voice calling for blood, he knew there was no turning back. Launching himself over the barricade,
Diarmuid leapt to Gráinne’s side. The chase was on. 02:45The pair ventured west, where they soon 
encountered the giant Modan. Eager to help the lovers, he guarded 
them at night and carried them by day. And once the pair had crossed
countless rivers and hills, their fear began to ease. They left the forest’s cover, laughing, 
flirting, and growing bolder each day. 03:04But Fionn saw their contentment
was an opportunity. He enlisted three sea chiefs 
to capture the wandering lovers. Diarmuid scared them 
off with mystifying sword tricks— only for Fionn to send poisonous hounds. Diarmuid and Gráinne fled yet again 
into an even more tangled forest— a sight which filled the Fianna
with exhaustion. They implored Fionn to give up the hunt,
and at this, their leader grew quiet. He’d already lost a dear friend— now it seemed his wrath had cost him
the respect of his men as well. Swallowing his rage, 
he called off the chase. 03:45For years, Gráinne and Diarmuid
lived in peace. In time, Angus Óg even brokered 
an agreement between the warriors, and their conflict faded into memory. But Gráinne never forgot 
the love god’s warning. 04:00One day, Fionn invited Diarmuid 
on a boar hunt high in the mountains. While the two were riding,
a venomous boar charged them and mortally wounded Diarmuid. As he bled, the old warrior begged 
his friend for water, as all the Fianna knew drinking 
from the hands of Fionn Mac Cumhaill could save their lives. But as Fionn turned to aid Diarmuid,
his old resentments came rushing back. For just a moment, his fingers parted,
letting the water trickle to the ground. And by the time Fionn realized 
his mistake, it was too late. And the embers of rage that long burned
inside him were finally quenched by tears."
1,"The keys to a happier, healthier sex life",Emily Nagoski,Jul 2018,"How can we unlock the door to our own authentic sexual well-being? Sex educator Emily Nagoski suggests that the key is realizing that we are all normal, whatever our proclivities. In this playful but informative take on sex positivity, she delves into the science of sexuality to demonstrate how we can shed our insecurities and define pleasure on our own terms.", (17K),"Transcript (3 Languages)EnglishEspañol日本語Carl, TranslatorPeter Van de Ven, Reviewer00:20(Exhales deeply) Today, right? Please join me in one big, deep breath
before we dive into talking about sex. (Laughter) Just one big, slow, deep breath in. (Inhales) And a big, slow, deep breath out. (Exhales) OK, now let's talk about sex. So yes, my name is Emily.
I am a sex educator. It's the best job in the world. In the fall of 2010, I taught a class called
""Women's Sexuality"" at Smith College. It was a 100-level,
introductory-level class, but I shoehorned in
all the science I could, all the psychophysiology and all the neuroscience and even - God forbid - all the sociology, and at the end of this really
intense semester, I asked my students to write down just one really important thing
that they had learned. This is what they said: ""I'm normal."" ""I am normal."" ""Just because my sexuality
is not the same as other women's, that does not make me abnormal."" ""Everything is normal.
Bringing joy and confidence to sex."" ""I learned that everything is normal, making it possible for me to go
through the rest of my life with confidence and joy."" 187 students I had in that class, and more than half of them
wrote something along the lines of ... ""I'm normal."" So I sat in my office, and I read those responses
with tears in my eyes. There was something essential
to my students about feeling normal, and somehow my class had unlocked
the door to that feeling. Moments like that are why
I'm a sex educator; it's why I'm here. I mean, it's why I'm here in Nevada, but it's why I'm here: to give everyone on Earth an experience like the one
my students had, of unlocking the door
to their own authentic sexual well-being. So that's what I'm going to do
with you guys today. (Laughter) Because it turns out,
we all really are ... normal. The science says so. I can prove it! Are you ready? Let's do it! OK!
(Inhales deeply) The mechanism in your brain
that controls sexual response is the ""dual control model."" The dual control model -
that means there's how many parts? Two! Thank you! And if I tell you the first part is
the sexual accelerator or the ""gas pedal,"" that means the second part
has to be the ... ? Brake! They don't let just anybody
into these TED Talks. (Laughter) So, the sexual accelerator notices all the sexually-relevant
information in the environment, everything you see, hear,
smell, touch, taste or imagine, that your brain codes
as sexually relevant, and it sends the signal
that says ""Turn on."" And it is functioning at a low level
all the time, including right now, just the fact that we're talking about sex
is a little bit sexually relevant. At the same time that
that's happening, in parallel, your brake is noticing all the very good
reasons not to be turned on right now. This is everything you see, hear,
smell, touch, taste or imagine that your brain codes
as a potential threat. And it sends a signal
that says ""Turn off."" So the process of becoming aroused is the dual process of turning on the ons and turning off the offs. Usually when people struggle with
their sexual well-being, it's because - sometimes there's not enough
stimulation to the gas pedal, but more often, it's because
there's too much stimulation to the brake, and all kinds of things can hit the brake. Like: Are you worried
about unwanted pregnancy? Are you worried about your kids
walking in, in the middle? Are you really sure that your partner
loves your sexy body? Are you really sure
that you love your sexy body? Did you spend the first
two decades of your life in a culture that taught you that sex
is dangerous, disgusting and dirty? That's going to hit the brake, right? (Laughter) So the first thing science tells us to do when we're struggling
with our sexual functioning, when we want to access
our own authentic sexual well-being, is to start to think through: What are things that hit our accelerator?
What are the things that hit our brake? And especially, what are some strategies that we can use in order to minimise the things
that are hitting the brake? I'm going to talk about two
such evidence-based strategies at the end of the talk. But before I do that, I need to come clean
with you about something, which is that all that stuff I just said isn't anywhere near as simple
as I made it sound. Sorry. To explain what I mean, I'll tell you about
the only affective neuroscience that has ever made me laugh out loud. OK. So I need you to imagine
that you're a lab rat. You're a very savvy, experienced lab rat and the researchers have inserted a probe
into your nucleus accumbens, a little, sort of jellybean-shaped thing
in the middle of your emotional brain. It's a painless procedure,
the researchers are clear to say. Plink! So you're this sort of
semi-remote-controlled bionic rat, and you're in a three-chambered box, here you are in box #1 -
just the ordinary lab environment - there's a bit of noise, the lights are on,
but it's fine, you're good at this. So when the researchers
zap the front of your nucleus accumbens, here's what you do: Ooh, ooh! What's that? Ooh! So these are approach, moving toward,
curious behaviors, right? Ooh! What's that? And then, in this ordinary
lab environment - the first box - when they zap the back
of your nucleus accumbens, you do this: aaah, what the hell is that!? You're kicking up dust
in the face of the predator. These are stress, avoidance,
dread responses, right? Moving away as opposed to moving towards. Hit the front? Ooh..! What's that?
Hit the back? What the hell is that!? Got that?
(Laughter) That's box #1. So we move into box #2. Now box #2 is silent, and it's dark, and it smells like your mother. (Laughter) It is ... I call it the ""Rat Spa."" It's the most peaceful, calm state of mind
you can imagine being in, and when they zap the front
of your nucleus accumbens, What do you do? Ooh, ooh! What's that? Ooh! And then, when they zap the back
of your nucleus accumbens, What do they do? Ooh, ooh! What's that? When you're in a calm, relaxed,
peaceful state of mind, your brain will interpret
almost any sensation as something that should be
approached with curiosity. Even stimulation
that in a different context, it might interpret as a potential threat
to be moved away from. But wait ... There's more! (Laughter) We move to box #3. So, here in box #3,
the lights are on really bright, music's played at different volumes,
you can't even get used to it, they specify in the research paper - this made me laugh out loud - they specify they're playing Iggy Pop. So ...
(Laughter) Imagine ""Lust for Life"" is playing
at lots of different volumes, you can't get used to it, you're an introverted bookworm
in the worst nightclub in the world, and when they zap the front
of your nucleus accumbens, What do you do? Aah..! What the hell is that!? Exactly! They don't let just anybody 
into these talks, that's amazing! So, when you are in a stressed-out, 
threatened state of mind, your brain will interpret almost
any sensation as something to be avoided, as a potential threat - even stimulation
that in a different context, it might've interpreted as something
to be approached with curiosity. All of which is a really nerdy way of describing a thing all
of us have experienced in the form of tickling. (Laughter) Because, you know,
tickling is not everyone's favorite, that's fair, I understand, but at least hypothetically,
you can imagine a world where you're in a sexy, fun,
flirty state of mind already, and your certain special someone
starts tickling on you, and it can feel fun and playful and
potentially lead to further nooky, right? But if that exact same
certain special someone tried to tickle when you were
pissed off at them, (Laughter) how would that feel? As one of my students recently put it:
""Violence would shortly ensue."" (Laughter) But the weird thing is,
it's exactly the same sensation, but because the context is different, your brain interprets it
entirely the opposite way. So when I say, ""Turn on the ons,
and turn off the offs,"" it's nowhere near as simple as just
""Touch me here - don't touch me that way."" What it means is, create a context
that allows your brain to interpret the world
as a pleasurable, safe, sexy place. For most people - again, people vary - 
but for most people, that context is low stress,
high affection and high trust. Those three things are hard enough
to come by in the 21st century, but they are not actually the keys that unlock that door
to your authentic sexual well-being. Sorry! But this is the big moment, right? This is when I - here they are. I've got this satin
shiny pillow with tassels and two keys lying on it. Right here: the keys to your 
authentic sexual well-being. Don't you want to know what they are? I will explain. The first key says ""confidence,""
and the second key says ""joy."" How do they work? What do you mean? 
Where do I get them? Confidence - Confidence comes from knowing 
what is true about your body, your sexuality, your internal experience. Knowing what's true. Knowing that you have a brake,
for example, as well as an accelerator. Knowing that they're sensitive to context, knowing what's true even if it's not what you were taught
to expect would be true, even if it's not what you
were taught ""should"" be true. Confidence is knowing what is true. Joy ... is loving what's true. Loving your brake
as much as your accelerator, loving that they're sensitive to context, loving what's true even if it's not what you were taught
to expect would be true, even - especially - if it's not
what you were taught ""should"" be true. And I guarantee you, you're going to walk out of here
with both keys in your pocket. I'm going to tell you specifically
how to get your hands on them. But first, I need to talk to you
about a cartoon panda. (Laughter) Have you seen the movie ""Kung-fu Panda""? It's about a cartoon panda named Po; he becomes a kung-fu master -
""Kung Fu Panda"" - by diligent effort,
the support of his teacher and the wisdom of the Dragon Scroll. The Dragon Scroll contains the key
to limitless power! And when Po first gets his hands 
on the Dragon Scroll he is ... disappointed because there's nothing written on it. It's blank. It just reflects his face. And then comes his epiphany: There is no secret ingredient. It's just ... you. And that is how
you get your hands on the keys that unlock the door
to your own authentic sexual well-being, by turning toward your own 
internal experience with calm curiosity. Ooh! What's that? Because it turns out
the key to limitless power is you. And now I will tell you the two concrete, specific,
evidence-based things that you can do in order to increase your grasp 
on these two keys of confidence and joy. Ready? Thing #1: What I want you to do is stand in front of a mirror
as close to naked as you can tolerate. (Laughter) It gets worse! (Laughter) So what you're going to do
is look at what you see there, and you're going to write down
everything that you see that you like. 12:45Of course, first your brain will flood
with culturally-constructed messages about how your body falls short
of the culturally-constructed ideal - that's fine, you have every other minute of the day
to have those self-critical thoughts, just set them aside, temporarily. 
 Right now, you will write down
the things you see that you like. If it is your eyelashes, write that down. If it's your toenails, write that down. And then do it again tomorrow. And then do it again the next day, and the next day, and the more often you do it, the more obvious it will become to you what a frickin' frackin'
miracle your body is, and the more immune you'll become to all the cultural, noisy crap
that's hitting the brakes. Option #2: If you genuinely
cannot imagine looking in a mirror and seeing anything there
that you would like, here's what I want you to do instead. I want you to get into a calm,
quiet state of mind, just for a couple of minutes each day, and I want you to visualize that door, that door that stands between you
and your authentic sexual well-being. And what I want you to do 
when you can see it really clearly, is that I want you to shine a beacon 
of kindness and compassion on the door. Because here's the thing about the door:
It's not innate, you weren't born with it. It was constructed in your brain by
your life experience and by your culture, and you may hate the culture
that built that door, you may work to change 
the culture that built that door, but never turn toward 
the door itself with hate, because the door is part of you too. And it is not random, 
it's there to do some work. If you've been shamed
for what's on the other side of that door, if you have been shamed
for your sexuality - and who hasn't? - that door is there trying to protect you 
from social isolation and judgement. If you have had what's behind that door - if you had your own sexuality
used against you as a weapon, if you're a survivor of sexual violence, your door is there doing
really important work. I'm talking here about one in four - you've heard these statistics already - one in four women in America,
one in six men ... One in four women in this room, one in six men. And two thirds of transgender folks. If that's you, your door is doing 
the hard work of helping you to survive in a world where your own sexuality 
can be used against you as a weapon, and it is working! You know how I can tell? Here you are! Surviving. And I am so grateful to your door 
for doing that really important work, and I don't know if your door
might be ready to open a little bit or if your door needs
to stay closed a little while longer, but I know that the first step is always to turn toward the door 
with kindness and compassion. Confidence is knowing what's true about you, your sexuality,
your internal experience. Joy is loving what's true even when it's not what you
were taught ""should"" be true. I'm a sex educator. It's the best job in the world! (Laughter) I teach people to live with confidence 
and joy inside their bodies, but really all that means is I offer them the science
that helps them find the way back to themselves. Because it turns out we all really are ... Oh, who am I kidding?
We're not just normal! We, the human species, we're amazing! We - all of us - are beguiling,
we are courageous, God knows we are delectable, we are all the way down the alphabet
to ""yopping"" and ""zesty."" (Laughter) Your body - (Cheering) (Applause) It's you guys! Your body is perfect. 
Exactly the way it is. The science says so. And now you can prove it! Thank you very much. (Cheering) (Applause)"

And when I met him, I was in awe of witnessing this tiny,
beautiful being enter into our lives. I also had this realization
that he wasn't just entering our lives, he was entering the world -- this crazy world that, especially now,
feels so incredibly challenging. I spend a lot time in my work
talking to people about who we are, who we must be and what our healing looks like. 00:36So the first time I held him, I had my pep talk ready. You know, I wanted him to know
that the way we find our strength is through our challenges. I wanted him to know
that we can all do something big when we start small. I wanted him to know
that each of us is more resilient than we could ever imagine. So here I am holding little Thelonious. I look down at him, and it hits me: he's a baby. 01:05(Laughter) 01:06He's not going to understand
a single word I say to him. So instead, I thought
it would probably be a better idea if I went home and wrote. So, this is for grownups, but it's also for Thelonious, when he's old enough to read it: 01:24footnotefootnoteThe world will say to you, ""Be a better person."" Do not be afraid to say, ""Yes."" Start by being a better listener. Start by being better
at walking down the street. See people. Say, ""Hello."" Ask how they are doing
and listen to what they say. Start by being a better friend, a better parent,
a better child to your parents; a better sibling, a better lover,
a better partner. Start by being a better neighbor. Meet someone you do not know,
and get to know them. 02:03The world will say to you, ""What are you going to do?"" Do not be afraid to say, ""I know I can't do everything, but I can do something."" Walk into more rooms saying, ""I'm here to help."" Become intimate with generosity. Give what you can give,
and do what you can do. Give dollars, give cents, give your time, give your love, give your heart, give your spirit. 02:33The world will say to you, ""We need peace."" Find your peace within, hold it sacred, bring it with you everywhere you go. Peace cannot be shared
or created with others if we cannot first generate it within. 02:54The world will say to you, ""They are the enemy."" Love enough to know that just because someone
disagrees with you, it does not make them your enemy. You may not win an argument, you may not change a mind, but if you choose to, you can always achieve
the triumph of radical empathy -- an understanding of the heart. 03:19footnotefootnoteThe world will say to you, ""We need justice."" Investigate. Find truth beyond
the stories you are told. Find truth beyond the way things seem. Ask, ""Why?"" Ask, ""Is this fair?"" Ask, ""How did we get here?"" Do this with compassion. Do this with forgiveness. Learn to forgive others. Start by truly learning
how to forgive yourself. We are all more than our mistakes. We are all more
than who we were yesterday. We are all deserving of our dignity. See yourself in others. Recognize that your justice is my justice, and mine is yours. There can be no liberation for one of us
if the other is not free. 04:13(Applause) 04:16The world will say to you, ""I am violent."" Respond by saying, ""I am not. Not with my words
and not with my actions."" 04:29The world will say to you, ""We need to heal the planet."" Start by saying, ""No, thank you.
I don't need a plastic bag."" Recycle, reuse. Start by picking up
one piece of trash on your block. 04:43footnotefootnoteThe world will say to you, ""There are too many problems."" Do not be afraid
to be a part of the solutions. Start by discussing the issues. We cannot overcome what we ignore. The more we talk about things, the more we see
that the issues are connected because we are connected. 05:06The world will say to you, ""We need to end racism."" Start by healing it in your own family. 05:14The world will say to you, ""How do we speak to bias and bigotry?"" Start by having the first conversation
at your own kitchen table. 05:24The world will say to you, ""There is so much hate."" Devote yourself to love. Love yourself so much
that you can love others without barriers and without judgment. When the world asks us big questions
that require big answers, we have two options. One: to feel so overwhelmed
or unqualified, we do nothing. Two: to start with one small act
and qualify ourselves. I am the director of national security, and so are you. Maybe no one appointed us
and there were no senate confirmations, but we can secure a nation. When you help just one person
to be more secure, a nation is more secure. With just one outstretched hand
that says, ""Are you OK? I am here for you,"" we can transform insecurity into security. 06:24We find ourselves saying to the world, ""What should I do?""
""What should we do?"" The better question might be: ""How am I showing up?"" I ask the world for peace, but do I show up with peace
when I see my family and friends? I ask the world to end hatred, but do I show up with love
not only for those I know, but those I don't know? Do I show up with love for those
whose ideas conflict with my own? I ask the world to end suffering, but do I show up for those
who are suffering on my street corner? We say to the world, ""Please change; we need change."" But how do we show up
to change our own lives? How do we show up to change the lives
of the people in our communities? 07:12James Baldwin said, ""Everything now,
we must assume is in our own hands; we have no right to assume otherwise."" This has always been true. 07:23footnotefootnoteNo one nominated
Harriet Tubman to her purpose, to her mission, to her courage. She did not say, ""I'm not a congressman or the president of the United States, so how could I possibly participate
in the fight to abolish a system as big as slavery?"" She instead spent 10 years
making 19 trips, freeing 300 people, one group of people at a time. Think about the children
of those 300 people, the grandchildren,
the great-grandchildren and beyond. Our righteous acts create
immeasurable ripples in the endless river of justice. 08:03Whether it's Hurricane Katrina, Harvey,
Irma or Maria, people did not say, ""There is so much damage.
What should I do?"" They got to work on what they could do. Those with boats got in their boats and started loading in every woman,
man and child they came across. Near and far, people gave their dollars, they gave their cents, they gave their hearts, they gave their spirit. 08:29We spend so much time thinking we don't have
the power to change the world. We forget that the power to change
someone's life is always in our hands. Change-making does not belong
to one group of people; it belongs to all of us. You don't have to wait
on anyone to tell you that you are in this. Begin. Start by doing what you can
with what you've got, where you are and in your own way. 09:03footnotefootnoteWe don't have to be heroes, wear a uniform, call ourselves activists or get elected to participate. We just have to be brave enough to care. 09:16Now, around the time Thelonious was born, I went to the birthday party
of a man named Gene Moretti. It was his 100th birthday, which means he lived in the United States
through the Depression, World War II, the struggle for workers' rights, the achievement
of a woman's right to vote, the Civil Rights Movement, a man on the moon, the Vietnam War and the election
of the first black president. I sat with him, and I said, ""Gene, you have lived
in America for 100 years. Do you have any advice
during these current times?"" He smiled and said to me simply, ""Yes. Be good to as many people as possible."" And as he danced with my mother, who is, by the way, half his age, in a room full of generations
of his family and hundreds of people, many of whom traveled thousands of miles
to be there to celebrate him, I realized that he had not
just given me advice, he had given me the first step that every single one of us
is capable of making if we want to create
a real, wholehearted impact on the world around us, right now. 10:33""Be good to as many people as possible."" 10:38Thank you. 10:39(Applause)"
1,"""First Kiss""",Tim Seibles,Apr 2019,"Sex therapist Ian Kerner hears about a common problem from his patients: ""failure to launch,"" or the inability to build and maintain sexual momentum. What's the solution? Whether you're looking to reignite the spark in your relationship or reconnect with your own desire, Kerner shares advice on how to cultivate your erotic imagination and get back on the ""arousal runway."" (Note: This talk contains mature content. In order to protect patient privacy, the speaker has combined or adj...", (12K),"Transcript (6 Languages)EnglishEspañolTiếng Việtالعربية中文 (简体)中文 (繁體)FootnotesFootnotes00:00So having a sex problem
is like having a toothache. By the time you get to the dentist,
or to me, a sex therapist, you just want to get out of pain. But what we just went through with COVID,
that was like a sexual root canal. I mean, we spent months
not changing out of our pajamas. And sometimes not showering. No wonder so many of us lost our libidos. It's not that we're not sexual people. We want to want sex. We just don't want it. 00:34footnotefootnoteIn my work with couples, one of the biggest problems I see is that sex often stalls out
before it even gets started. There’s a “failure to launch,” an inability to get going
and gain momentum. For example, one of my patients shuts down as soon as her partner starts to kiss her. Turns out, her boyfriend
in the eighth grade told her she had bad breath. Another patient of mine
is terrified of losing his erection, so much so that he avoids any situation
that could possibly lead to sex. But he tells his partner he has no desire, and he blames it on work stress. Meanwhile, he's filled with longing. He just doesn't dare show it. And so his partner
feels confused and unattractive. 01:29For some of us, there just
isn't room in our busy lives for sexual energy to emerge. There isn’t what I call the “erotic
thread” between sexual events, those moments when
we can express desire or feel desire, pivot in and out of a quick sexual charge
just for the heck of it. So, you know, it's no surprise that by the time we actually
do get around to finally having sex, too often it can feel reduced to a mundane series
of predictable behaviors, stale and drained of erotic life. So why even bother? 02:09Whenever the issue is a failure to launch, what we really need is a new way in, what I call an arousal runway. And I firmly believe that that runway needs to be in the form
of psychological arousal, not just physical. For example, we know that some women
can fantasize their way to orgasm without ever touching themselves. And men -- well, men
can just look at something sexy or think about something sexy and start to get
a strong physical reaction. That's the power of psychological arousal. So why aren't we sharing
more of it with each other? 02:50Well, in the beginning of a relationship,
we really don't need to. The newness itself is often
its own form of psychological stimuli. But as we go on, and as our sexual connection
starts to lose its vitality, that's when we need to be more deliberate
about engaging our erotic minds together. Otherwise, we might start to drift apart. We might start to fall
into a sexless relationship. Some of us might even start to cheat, which is the only way that many of us know
to get back on that arousal runway. 03:29I have rarely met a couple that doesn't understand
the importance of psychological arousal and doesn't want
more of it in the bedroom, but they often just
don't know where to begin. So I give homework assignments that emphasize two types
of psychological arousal: face to face and side by side. Face to face is things
like sharing a fantasy, role-playing a sexy scenario, engaging in sexual role-play. Activities that two people can do
just between themselves with only their imaginations. Well, that's easier said than done. With so much shame
and inhibition around sex that takes willingness, it takes vulnerability,
and it takes courage. So I often suggest starting out
with a side by side experience, something that's a little less pressured. Reading some literary erotica
aloud together, listening to a sexy podcast,
watching ethical porn. That's the kind where the performers
actually want to be there. 04:41Recently, I was working
with a heterosexual couple that needed an arousal boost. They were trying to get back into sex
after having a baby. And she especially needed help
tuning out the stressors and getting into a sexual mindset. But as a breastfeeding mom,
she felt totally touched out. So she loved the idea
of psychological arousal. She thought it would be a blast
to watch porn together. She never did anything
like that in her life. But for him, that was
something private and off limits, and he was worried that she was going
to judge him based on his tastes. So I came up with a solution. I gave them a list of ethical porn sites, and I asked them, ""Hey, how do you feel about each picking a scene or two
that you think would turn on the other?"" Well, not only was he willing to do that, it led to a fascinating and funny
follow-up conversation. He asked her, ""Why exactly
did you pick tickle torture for me?"" 05:47(Laughter) 05:48So starting side by side, it helps us get face to face. But then that face to face arousal, it needs to be more
than just putting on sexy lingerie or buying handcuffs and a blindfold. On their own, those things
are pretty inert. What makes them arousing is when they
enable us to tap into our fantasies, or what the late great sex therapist
Jack Morin called a “core erotic theme.” Sexual scenarios that uniquely
turn us on more than others, and they hold on
to that erotic charge over time. 06:31footnotefootnoteWell, a lot of couples say
they don't have fantasies or they don't know
what their fantasies are. But once you start having
those side by side experiences, those erotic themes start to emerge
and get talked about. Like the couple with the new baby. Why did she end up
picking tickle torture for him? Well, she felt like
he needed to lose control, both in and out of the bedroom, and he was very ticklish. Because she was the one who actually
had to go through the pain of childbirth, but then he made such a big deal
about being in the delivery room and having to watch and how hard it was, he needed to be punished for that. 07:15(Laughter) 07:16And because she loved the idea of just
stepping out of her nurturing mom role and for a little while
being a powerful dominatrix. I can't say they ever got as far
as actually engaging in tickle torture, but I do know that they started to move
from side by side to face to face and started to play with power
in ways that they both found really hot. 07:41So what if you are someone
who fantasizes during sex but you keep it to yourself? Does that count a psychological arousal? And what if the person
you're fantasizing about isn't the person
you're actually having sex with? That can be confusing. You might start to wonder,
""What's going on here? Am I bored? Am I not into the sex?
Am I cheating in my mind? Should I push those thoughts
out of my head?"" No. Our fantasies are our allies. They help distract us away from the chaotic world
outside of our bedroom, and they lead us and they lull us
into our sexual bodies so that we can tune in and turn on. Our fantasies are our friends. You don't fear them. You follow them. 08:44Now does that mean you should
take your partner with you and tell them about that secret fantasy? Well, that depends. It could be a great way of going deeper
into that face-to-face arousal. But on the other hand, if you and your partner
are just starting to dip your toes into the shallow end of the fantasy pool, well, then you might want to hang out in the intermediate section
a little bit, you know, like splash around a little bit,
get comfortable, develop some emotional safety, establish boundaries. I mean, maybe you got
to make it clear to your partner, ""Hey, just so we know, fantasy is fantasy
because it's not reality, right?"" There's a line between thought and action. And just because you happen to have
erotic themes that turn you on and that include others, that doesn't mean that the sex
isn't still just about the two of you. 09:44A bunch of years ago, I did a study with Dr Kristen Mark
on the topic of sexual boredom. We surveyed nearly 3,500 people
in committed relationships and found that more than 50 percent were
either bored or on the brink of boredom. Women were twice as likely to be bored
in the first year of a relationship, and men got bored
in the first three years. That's a whole lot of boredom
on both sides of the bed. But the good news, the vast majority of respondents
were entirely interested in trying something new
that their partners suggested. So the antidote to boredom,
it could just be a sexy suggestion away. It could be as simple
as waking up one morning, looking at your partner and just saying, ""Hey, I just had
the hottest dream about you."" And then you fill in the blanks. If it makes you blush,
just blame it on your subconscious. The point is that sexy suggestion, that little nugget
of psychological arousal, that could be the difference
between lying in bed next to someone and feeling a million miles apart, or getting on that arousal runway
together and taking off. 11:12So what do you think? After a year and a half of being grounded, Isn't it time to spread our sexual wings
and let ourselves fly? 11:25Thank you."
1,Technology hasn't changed love. Here's why,Helen Fisher,Sep 2016,"In our tech-driven, interconnected world, we've developed new ways and rules to court each other, but the fundamental principles of love have stayed the same, says anthropologist Helen Fisher.

in the Highlands of New Guinea, and I was talking with a man
who had three wives. I asked him, ""How many wives
would you like to have?"" And there was this long pause, and I thought to myself, ""Is he going to say five? Is he going to say 10? Is he going to say 25?"" And he leaned towards me and he whispered, ""None."" 00:20(Laughter) 00:23Eighty-six percent of human societies
permit a man to have several wives: polygyny. But in the vast majority
of these cultures, only about five or ten percent of men
actually do have several wives. Having several partners
can be a toothache. In fact, co-wives can
fight with each other, sometimes they can even poison
each other's children. And you've got to have
a lot of cows, a lot of goats, a lot of money, a lot of land, in order to build a harem. 00:51footnotefootnoteWe are a pair-bonding species. Ninety-seven percent of mammals
do not pair up to rear their young; human beings do. I'm not suggesting that we're not -- that we're necessarily
sexually faithful to our partners. I've looked at adultery in 42 cultures, I understand, actually,
some of the genetics of it, and some of the brain circuitry of it. It's very common around the world, but we are built to love. 01:15footnotefootnoteHow is technology changing love? I'm going to say almost not at all. I study the brain. I and my colleagues have put
over 100 people into a brain scanner -- people who had just
fallen happily in love, people who had just been rejected in love and people who are in love long-term. And it is possible
to remain ""in love"" long-term. And I've long ago maintained that we've evolved three distinctly
different brain systems for mating and reproduction: sex drive, feelings of intense romantic love and feelings of deep cosmic
attachment to a long-term partner. And together, these three brain systems -- with many other parts of the brain -- orchestrate our sexual,
our romantic and our family lives. 02:02But they lie way below the cortex, way below the limbic system
where we feel our emotions, generate our emotions. They lie in the most primitive parts
of the brain, linked with energy, focus, craving, motivation,
wanting and drive. In this case, the drive to win life's greatest prize: a mating partner. They evolved over 4.4 million years ago
among our first ancestors, and they're not going to change
if you swipe left or right on Tinder. 02:34(Laughter) 02:36(Applause) 02:38There's no question that technology
is changing the way we court: emailing, texting, emojis to express your emotions, sexting, ""liking"" a photograph, selfies ... We're seeing new rules
and taboos for how to court. But, you know -- is this actually
dramatically changing love? What about the late 1940s, when the automobile became very popular and we suddenly had rolling bedrooms? 03:09(Laughter) 03:10How about the introduction
of the birth control pill? Unchained from the great threat
of pregnancy and social ruin, women could finally express
their primitive and primal sexuality. 03:25Even dating sites are not changing love. I'm Chief Scientific Advisor to Match.com, I've been it for 11 years. I keep telling them
and they agree with me, that these are not dating sites, they are introducing sites. When you sit down in a bar, in a coffee house, on a park bench, your ancient brain snaps into action
like a sleeping cat awakened, and you smile and laugh and listen and parade the way our ancestors
did 100,000 years ago. We can give you various people -- all the dating sites can -- but the only real algorithm
is your own human brain. Technology is not going to change that. 04:09footnotefootnoteTechnology is also not going to change
who you choose to love. I study the biology of personality, and I've come to believe that we've evolved four very broad
styles of thinking and behaving, linked with the dopamine, serotonin, testosterone and estrogen systems. So I created a questionnaire
directly from brain science to measure the degree to which
you express the traits -- the constellation of traits -- linked with each
of these four brain systems. I then put that questionnaire
on various dating sites in 40 countries. Fourteen million or more people
have now taken the questionnaire, and I've been able to watch
who's naturally drawn to whom. 04:54And as it turns out, those who were very expressive
of the dopamine system tend to be curious, creative,
spontaneous, energetic -- I would imagine there's an awful lot
of people like that in this room -- they're drawn to people like themselves. Curious, creative people
need people like themselves. People who are very expressive
of the serotonin system tend to be traditional, conventional,
they follow the rules, they respect authority, they tend to be religious -- religiosity
is in the serotonin system -- and traditional people
go for traditional people. In that way, similarity attracts. In the other two cases, opposites attract. People very expressive
of the testosterone system tend to be analytical,
logical, direct, decisive, and they go for their opposite: they go for somebody who's high estrogen, somebody who's got very good verbal skills and people skills, who's very intuitive and who's very nurturing
and emotionally expressive. We have natural patterns of mate choice. Modern technology is not going
to change who we choose to love. 05:57footnotefootnoteBut technology is producing
one modern trend that I find particularly important. It's associated with the concept
of paradox of choice. For millions of years, we lived in little hunting
and gathering groups. You didn't have the opportunity to choose between 1,000 people on a dating site. In fact, I've been studying this recently, and I actually think there's some
sort of sweet spot in the brain; I don't know what it is, but apparently,
from reading a lot of the data, we can embrace about five
to nine alternatives, and after that, you get into what academics
call ""cognitive overload,"" and you don't choose any. 06:36footnotefootnoteSo I've come to think that due
to this cognitive overload, we're ushering in a new form of courtship that I call ""slow love."" I arrived at this during
my work with Match.com. Every year for the last six years, we've done a study called
""Singles in America."" We don't poll the Match population, we poll the American population. We use 5,000-plus people, a representative sample of Americans
based on the US census. 07:04We've got data now on over 30,000 people, and every single year, I see some of the same patterns. Every single year when I ask the question, over 50 percent of people
have had a one-night stand -- not necessarily last year,
but in their lives -- 50 percent have had
a friends with benefits during the course of their lives, and over 50 percent have lived
with a person long-term before marrying. Americans think that this is reckless. I have doubted that for a long time; the patterns are too strong. There's got to be some
Darwinian explanation -- Not that many people are crazy. 07:41footnotefootnoteAnd I stumbled, then, on a statistic
that really came home to me. It was a very interesting academic article in which I found that 67 percent
of singles in America today who are living long-term with somebody, have not yet married because
they are terrified of divorce. They're terrified of the social, legal, emotional, economic consequences of divorce. So I came to realize that I don't think
this is recklessness; I think it's caution. Today's singles want to know
every single thing about a partner before they wed. You learn a lot between the sheets, not only about how somebody makes love, but whether they're kind, whether they can listen and at my age, whether they've got a sense of humor. 08:29(Laughter) 08:31And in an age where we have
too many choices, we have very little fear
of pregnancy and disease and we've got no feeling of shame
for sex before marriage, I think people are taking
their time to love. 08:46And actually, what's happening is, what we're seeing is a real expansion
of the precommitment stage before you tie the knot. Where marriage used to be
the beginning of a relationship, now it's the finale. But the human brain -- 09:01(Laughter) 09:03footnotefootnoteThe human brain always triumphs, and indeed, in the United States today, 86 percent of Americans
will marry by age 49. And even in cultures around the world
where they're not marrying as often, they are settling down eventually
with a long-term partner. 09:17So it began to occur to me: during this long extension
of the precommitment stage, if you can get rid of bad
relationships before you marry, maybe we're going to see
more happy marriages. So I did a study of 1,100
married people in America -- not on Match.com, of course -- and I asked them a lot of questions. But one of the questions was, ""Would you re-marry the person
you're currently married to?"" And 81 percent said, ""Yes."" 09:48footnotefootnoteIn fact, the greatest change
in modern romance and family life is not technology. It's not even slow love. It's actually women
piling into the job market in cultures around the world. For millions of years, our ancestors lived
in little hunting and gathering groups. Women commuted to work
to gather their fruits and vegetables. They came home with 60 to 80
percent of the evening meal. The double-income family was the rule. And women were regarded
as just as economically, socially and sexually powerful as men. 10:24Then the environment changed
some 10,000 years ago, we began to settle down on the farm and both men and women
became obliged, really, to marry the right person, from the right background, from the right religion and from the right kin
and social and political connections. Men's jobs became more important: they had to move the rocks,
fell the trees, plow the land. They brought the produce
to local markets, and came home with the equivalent of money. 10:49Along with this, we see a rise of a host of beliefs: the belief of virginity at marriage, arranged marriages --
strictly arranged marriages -- the belief that the man
is the head of the household, that the wife's place is in the home and most important, honor thy husband,
and 'til death do us part. These are gone. They are going, and in many places, they are gone. 11:14We are right now in a marriage revolution. We are shedding 10,000 years
of our farming tradition and moving forward towards egalitarian
relationships between the sexes -- something I regard as highly compatible
with the ancient human spirit. 11:33I'm not a Pollyanna; there's a great deal to cry about. I've studied divorce in 80 cultures, I've studied, as I say,
adultery in many -- there's a whole pile of problems. As William Butler Yeats,
the poet, once said, ""Love is the crooked thing."" I would add, ""Nobody gets out alive."" 11:51(Laughter) 11:53We all have problems. But in fact, I think the poet
Randall Jarrell really sums it up best. He said, ""The dark, uneasy world
of family life -- where the greatest can fail,
and the humblest succeed."" 12:08But I will leave you with this: love and attachment will prevail, technology cannot change it. And I will conclude by saying any understanding of human relationships
must take into account one the most powerful determinants
of human behavior: the unquenchable, adaptable and primordial human drive to love. 12:33Thank you. 12:34(Applause) 12:39Kelly Stoetzel: Thank you
so much for that, Helen. As you know, there's another
speaker here with us that works in your same field. She comes at it
from a different perspective. Esther Perel is a psychotherapist
who works with couples. You study data, Esther studies the stories
the couples tell her when they come to her for help. Let's have her join us on the stage. Esther? 13:02(Applause) 13:10So Esther, when you were watching Helen's talk, was there any part of it that resonated with you
through the lens of your own work that you'd like to comment on? 13:20Esther Perel: It's interesting,
because on the one hand, the need for love
is ubiquitous and universal. But the way we love -- the meaning we make out of it -- the rules that govern
our relationships, I think, are changing fundamentally. 13:35We come from a model that, until now, was primarily regulated
around duty and obligation, the needs of the collective and loyalty. And we have shifted it to a model of free choice
and individual rights, and self-fulfillment and happiness. And so, that was
the first thing I thought, that the need doesn't change, but the context and the way
we regulate these relationships changes a lot. 14:02On the paradox of choice -- you know, on the one hand
we relish the novelty and the playfulness, I think, to be able to have so many options. And at the same time, as you talk about this cognitive overload, I see many, many people who ... who dread the uncertainty and self-doubt that comes with this massa of choice, creating a case of ""FOMO"" and then leading us -- FOMO, fear of missed opportunity,
or fear of missing out -- it's like, ""How do I know
I have found 'the one' -- the right one?"" 14:40So we've created what I call
this thing of ""stable ambiguity."" Stable ambiguity is when
you are too afraid to be alone but also not really willing
to engage in intimacy-building. It's a set of tactics that kind of prolong
the uncertainty of a relationship but also the uncertainty of the breakup. So, here on the internet
you have three major ones. One is icing and simmering, which are great stalling tactics that offer a kind of holding pattern that emphasizes the undefined
nature of a relationship but at the same time gives you
enough of a comforting consistency and enough freedom
of the undefined boundaries. 15:21(Laughter) 15:24Yeah? 15:25And then comes ghosting. And ghosting is, basically, you disappear from this massa
of texts on the spot, and you don't have to deal with
the pain that you inflict on another, because you're making it
invisible even to yourself. 15:39(Laughter) 15:41Yeah? 15:42So I was thinking -- these words came up
for me as I was listening to you, like how a vocabulary
also creates a reality, and at the same time, that's my question to you: Do you think when the context changes, it still means that the nature
of love remains the same? 16:02You study the brain and I study
people's relationships and stories, so I think it's everything you say, plus. But I don't always know the degree
to which a changing context ... Does it at some point begin to change -- If the meaning changes,
does it change the need, or is the need clear
of the entire context? 16:23HF: Wow! Well -- 16:25(Laughter) 16:27(Applause) 16:30Well, I've got three points here, right? First of all, to your first one: there's no question that we've changed,
that we now want a person to love, and for thousands of years,
we had to marry the right person from the right background
and right kin connection. And in fact, in my studies
of 5,000 people every year, I ask them, ""What are you looking for?"" And every single year,
over 97 percent say -- 16:53EP: The list grows -- 16:54HF: Well, no. The basic thing is
over 97 percent of people want somebody that respects them, somebody they can trust and confide in, somebody who makes them laugh, somebody who makes enough time for them and somebody who they find
physically attractive. That never changes. And there's certainly -- you know,
there's two parts -- 17:15EP: But you know how I call that? That's not what people used to say -- 17:19HF: That's exactly right. 17:21EP: They said they wanted somebody
with whom they have companionship, economic support, children. We went from a production economy
to a service economy. 17:28(Laughter) 17:29We did it in the larger culture,
and we're doing it in marriage. 17:32HF: Right, no question about it. But it's interesting, the millennials
actually want to be very good parents, whereas the generation above them
wants to have a very fine marriage but is not as focused
on being a good parent. You see all of these nuances. 17:46There's two basic parts of personality: there's your culture -- everything you
grew up to do and believe and say -- and there's your temperament. Basically, what I've been talking
about is your temperament. And that temperament is certainly
going to change with changing times and changing beliefs. 18:01And in terms of the paradox of choice, there's no question about it
that this is a pickle. There were millions of years
where you found that sweet boy at the other side of the water hole, and you went for it. 18:13EP: Yes, but you -- 18:14HF: I do want to say one more thing. The bottom line is, in hunting
and gathering societies, they tended to have two or three partners
during the course of their lives. They weren't square! And I'm not suggesting that we do, but the bottom line is,
we've always had alternatives. Mankind is always -- in fact, the brain is well-built
to what we call ""equilibrate,"" to try and decide: Do I come, do I stay? Do I go, do I stay? What are the opportunities here? How do I handle this there? And so I think we're seeing
another play-out of that now. 18:44KS: Well, thank you both so much. I think you're going to have
a million dinner partners for tonight! 18:48(Applause) 18:50Thank you, thank you."

are three senior citizens connected by a special relationship. They view their bond as a shield
from the loneliness of aging. 00:12I first met them at a retirement
home in Los Angeles, where I had been photographing
for three years. I saw as they approached
the gate one night, and felt an immediate connection to them. Although I didn't know the details
of their love triangle, I intuitively felt
that I had to find out who they were. Questioning a nurse
a day later, she said to me, ""Oh, you're talking about the threesome."" 00:40(Laughter) 00:41I was intrigued. 00:42(Laughter) 00:45The trio set out on a daily adventure
to coffee and doughnut shops, bus stops and street corners. I soon learned that the purpose
of these outings was solace and a search for meaning. The trio sought to combat their alienation by literally integrating themselves
in public streets. Yet, even when arm in arm,
no one saw them. 01:10We often think that as we age,
we lose the desires held in our youth. Actually, as a teenage photojournalist
when I met the trio, I saw their behavior as a mirror to the fears of exclusion
and desires for intimacy that I also carried. I related to their invisibility, which pained me during my childhood but has become my greatest asset
as an immersive documentarian, because I can just fade into my empathy. As we walked down
the streets of Hollywood, in a neighborhood of screenwriters,
actors and filmmakers, the trio assumed the invisibility
that each senior does. I would ask myself, ""How is it that no one else
sees these three human beings? Why is it that I am
the only one who sees them?"" 02:04Years later, as I began to share
this work with the public, I noticed that people are largely
uncomfortable with this story. Perhaps it is because the trio
doesn't assume conventional notions associated with love,
romance or partnership. They were unseen in public
and shunned by their peers. They wanted to belong somewhere but only seemed to belong with each other. I wanted to belong somewhere, too. And my camera has been a catalyst
for me to belong everywhere. 02:38But beyond challenging sociocultural
norms about the elderly, the trio sheds light
on fear of remoteness. At the end of each day, they return
to their respective retirement homes. Under the surface of their aloneness, there is a desire for community,
for their people. There was a sense that they were each
yearning for their tribe, but that comfort comes with compromise, because Will cannot commit to one woman. 03:10Sitting with Jeanie one day
in her apartment, she said to me, ""Sharing Will is a thorn in your side. A relationship between a man
and a woman is private. It is a couple, not a trio."" 03:25My process is to essentially
become the people I document by spending years with them
as an observer-occupant, to create a safe space,
to then become hidden in plain sight. 03:38I was about 17 when I met the trio, and I shadowed them for four years. We actually see, in the breakdown
of social development, that adolescence and old age
look strikingly alike, because both are periods
of identity confusion. I identified with the women. But also with Will, who made me
aware of the divide in me. The schism that we each often have about what we crave
and the actuality of our situation. 04:11Before shooting this series, I was also in love with two different
people who knew about each other, being the object over which they fought. But I also knew what it was like
to be at the base of the triangle, like Jeanie or Adina, asking myself, ""Why aren't I enough?"" I would look through my viewfinder
and see three elderly figures, and it became impossible to deny
that regardless of age, we were each in pursuit of filling
the proverbial hole through other people. 04:46Perhaps the discomfort of looking
at Jeanie, Will and Adina's story is truly a reminder
that even at the end of life, we may never reach the fantasy
we have envisioned for ourselves. Thank you for listening. 05:02(Applause)"
1,4 signs of emotional abuse,Viann Nguyen-Feng,Mar 2022,"Emotional abuse can be incredibly damaging, increasing a person's chances of developing depression and anxiety.

incredibly damaging, increasing a person’s chances 
of developing depression and anxiety sometimes for decades after the fact. Broadly speaking, emotional abuse involves
one person controlling another by undermining their sense of self-worth
and personal agency. But emotionally abusive behaviors can be
subtle and difficult to spot, both from within 
and outside the abusive relationship. That’s partly because emotional abuse
often exploits or creates power imbalances 
between individuals, especially in relationships
where safety, care, and trust are supposed to be guaranteed, like the relationship between
a caregiver and a child, healthcare provider and patient,
teacher and student, or intimate partners. It’s especially insidious because 
it often makes people doubt their perceptions 
of their own mistreatment. 01:04So let’s walk through some of the most
common signs of emotional abuse, to make these behaviors and patterns
easier to spot in real life. 01:13First, the content of someone’s words: criticism that’s out of proportion
to a situation, excessively harsh or personal,
or makes sweeping generalizations or baseless negative predictions 
for the future is a warning sign of emotional abuse. Statements like, “You always make
such stupid decisions,” “You never do anything right,” 
and “Nobody else will ever love you,” aren’t constructive; 
they’re never warranted, and someone’s use of them is a red flag. 01:43Second, tone and non-verbal cues: yelling, ignoring and showing contempt
through body language are all ways to degrade someone. Dismissive behaviors like eye rolling,
glaring, or refusal to make eye contact, along with refusing to speak to someone
or acknowledge their presence— sometimes called “the silent treatment”— can all feature in patterns 
of emotional abuse. These behaviors can painfully transform the meaning of spoken statements 
that might otherwise seem benign. 02:14Third, how someone reacts
to being told they’ve said or done something hurtful 
can give important insight: do they apologize sincerely 
and act differently in the future, or do they dismiss and minimize
the pain they’ve caused? It’s common for abusers to try 
to undermine their target’s perceptions of events— this is sometimes referred 
to as “gaslighting.” Following up demeaning,
humiliating, or threatening remarks with comments that dismiss
the impact of those remarks, like “I’m just trying to help you 
improve yourself— you should be grateful,” or “It’s really you that’s selfish 
and manipulative— you’re<i> </i>hurting me,” are examples of this behavior. 02:56Lastly, when someone directs any 
of these behaviors at you, take note of whether this is part 
of a pattern of behavior from them. A one-time incident of name-calling
or a demeaning insult might not be emotional abuse, while repetition over time can have 
a much more serious impact. Both frequency, how often these behaviors
occur in a given period of time, and duration, or how long they last, 
whether days or years, can contribute 
to the severity of the abuse. It’s also important to remember 
that abusers rarely engage in abusive behaviors 100% of the time— moments of kindness or calm 
don’t invalidate moments of abuse, but are actually part of the cycle
of emotional manipulation. 03:38So what can you do if you think you
or someone you care about is experiencing emotional abuse? Maintaining interpersonal ties with people
other than the abuser is crucial, as abusers often try to isolate 
their targets from others close to them. If you think you might be experiencing
emotional abuse, consider sharing your experiences
with a trusted friend or relative to get outside support. Or you can seek local or national
confidential advocacy centers that can provide helpful resources. And if you think someone you know
is being emotionally abused, check in with them. Let them know you’re thinking of them and that you're ready to listen
whenever they'd like to share. While emotional abusers may convince
people that they deserve to be mistreated, nobody does: everyone deserves
kindness and respect."
1,How understanding divorce can help your marriage,Jeannie Suk Gersen,Apr 2020,"To understand what makes marriages work, we need to talk about why they sometimes end, says family law professor Jeannie Suk Gersen. Follow along as she lays out three ways that thinking about marital decisions through the lens of divorce can help you better navigate togetherness from the beginning.", (90K),"Transcript (24 Languages)Bahasa IndonesiaEnglishEspañolFrançaisItalianoLietuvių kalbaMagyarPortuguês brasileiroPortuguês de PortugalRomânăShqipTiếng ViệtTürkçeΕλληνικάРусскийСрпски, Srpskiעבריתالعربيةفارسىहिन्दी中文 (简体)中文 (繁體)日本語한국어00:00""Till death do us part."" When we get married, we make vows. To love, to honor, to forsake all others. Or as a friend of mine put it, ""Not to leave dirty socks
all over the house."" 00:17(Laughter) 00:19We may fall short of some of our promises some of the time, but one that will always hold true
is that first one: ""Till death do us part."" Because spouses are bound together
by their decisions, in marriage and in divorce. 00:40So, a mentor of mine once told me, ""You should always marry
your second husband first."" 00:48(Laughter) 00:53What did that mean? It didn't mean that Mr. Right
is somehow waiting behind door number two. It meant that if you want to understand what makes a marriage work, you should think
about how a marriage ends. Divorce makes extremely explicit what the tacit rules of marriage are. And everyone should
understand those rules, because doing so can help us build
better marriages from the beginning. I know, it doesn't sound very romantic, but sometimes the things we do out of love can be the very things
that make it hard for that love to last. 01:48I am a family-law professor. I have taught students, I've been an attorney, I'm a mediator and I've also been divorced. And I'm now happily married
to my actual second husband. 02:04(Laughter) 02:07The reason that I think
this is so important is that I think everyone should be having
some of these very painful conversations that divorced people experience. These are painful conversations
about what we contributed, what we owe, what we are willing to give and what we give up. And also, what's important to us. Those conversations should be happening
in a good marriage, not after it is broken. Because when you wait until it's broken, it's too late. But if you have them early on, they can actually help build
a better marriage. 02:59Three ideas that I want
to put on the table for you to consider. One, sacrifice should be thought of
as a fair exchange. Two, there's no such thing
as free childcare. And three, what's yours
probably becomes ours. So let me talk about each of these ideas. 03:26The first one, sacrifice should be a fair exchange. Take the example of Lisa and Andy. Lisa decides to go to medical school
early in the marriage, and Andy works to support them. And Andy works night shifts
in order to do that, and he also gives up a great job
in another city. He does this out of love. But of course, he also understands that Lisa's degree
will benefit them both in the end. But after a few years,
Andy becomes neglected and resentful. And he starts drinking heavily. And Lisa looks at her life
and she looks at Andy and she thinks, ""This is not the bargain
I wanted to make."" A couple of years go by, she graduates from medical school, and she files for a divorce. 04:16So in my perfect world, some kind of marriage mediator
would have been able to talk to them before Lisa went to medical school. And at that point,
that mediator might have asked, ""How exactly does fair exchange work? What does it look like in your marriage? What are you willing to give
and what are you willing to owe?"" So in a divorce, Lisa now probably is going to owe Andy
financial support for years. And Andy ... no amount of financial support
is going to make him feel compensated for what he gave up, and the lost traction in his career. 05:05If the two of them had thought
about their split early on, what might have gone differently? Well, it's possible that Lisa
would have decided that she would take loans
or work a part-time job in order to support her own tuition so that Andy wouldn't have had to bear
the entire burden for that. And Andy might have decided
to take that job in that other city and maybe the two of them
would have commuted for a couple of years while Lisa finished her degree. 05:37So let's take another couple,
Emily and Deb. They live in a big city, they have two children, they both work. Emily gets a job in a small town, and they decide to move there together. And Deb quits her job
to look after the children full-time. Deb leaves behind an extended family, her friends and a job that she really liked. And in that small town,
Deb starts to feel isolated and lonely. And 10 years later, Deb has an affair, and things fall apart. 06:14Now, the marriage mediator
who would have come in before they moved
and before Deb quit her job might have asked them, ""What do your choices about childcare do to the obligations
you have to each other? How do they affect your relationship? Because you have to remember that there is no such thing
as free childcare."" 06:38If the two of them had thought
about their split beforehand, what would have gone differently? Well, maybe Deb would have
realized a little better how much her family and her friends
were important to her precisely in what she was taking on, which is full-time parenthood. Perhaps Emily, in weighing the excitement
of the new job offer might have also thought about
what that would mean for the cost to Deb and what would be owed to Deb as a result of her taking on
full-time parenthood. 07:17So, let's go back to Lisa and Andy. Lisa had an inheritance
from her grandmother before the marriage. And when they got married,
they bought a home, and Lisa put that inheritance
toward a down payment on that home. And then Andy of course worked
to make the mortgage payments. And all of their premarital
and marital property became joined. That inheritance is now marital property. So, in a split, what's going to happen? They're going to have to sell the house
and split the proceeds, or one of them can buy the other out. 07:55So this marriage mediator, if they had talked to them
before all of this happened, that person would have asked, ""What do you want to keep separate
and what do you want to keep together? And how does that choice actually support the security
of the marriage? Because you have to remember that what's yours,
probably, will become ours, unless you actually are mindful
and take steps to do otherwise."" 08:28So if they had thought about their split, maybe they would have decided differently, maybe Lisa would have thought, ""Maybe the inheritance can stay separate,"" and saved for a day
when they might actually need it. And maybe the mortgage that they took on
wouldn't have been as onerous, and maybe Andy wouldn't have had
to work so hard to make those payments. And maybe he would have
become less resentful. Maybe they would have lived
in a smaller house and been content to do that. 08:59The point is, if they had had
a divorce-conscious discussion about what to keep separate, their marriage might have been
more connected and more together. Too often in marriage, we make sacrifices, and we demand them, without reckoning their cost. But there is wisdom
in looking at the price tags attached to our marital decisions in just the way that divorce law
teaches us to do. 09:32What I want is for people to think
about their marital bargains through the lens of divorce. And to ask, ""How is marriage a sacrifice, but an exchange of sacrifice? How do we think about our exchange?"" Second: ""How do we think about childcare and deal with the fact that there is no such thing
as free childcare?"" ""How do we deal with the fact that some things can be separate
and some things can be together, and if we don't think about it, then it will all be part
of the joint enterprise."" 10:14So basically, what I want to leave you with
is that in marriage or divorce, people should think about the way that ""till death do us part"" marriage is forever. 10:33Thank you. 10:34(Applause)"
1,How reverse mentorship can help create better leaders,Patrice Gordon,Nov 2020,"Employee diversity and inclusive leadership are goals for most organizations today, but how do we get there? Try a ""reverse mentorship"" program, which sets up junior team members to guide senior staff. Here are 6 tips to make reverse mentorship work, from executive coach and personal development advocate Patrice Gordon.", (11K),"Transcript (20 Languages)Bahasa IndonesiaEnglishEspañolFrançaisGalegoPolskiPortuguês brasileiroPortuguês de PortugalRomânăTiếng ViệtTürkçeΕλληνικάРусскийעבריתالعربيةภาษาไทย中文 (简体)中文 (繁體)日本語한국어Translate @ TED, TranslatorIvana Korom, ReviewerFootnotesFootnotes00:00We've always thought of mentoring as the older generation
passing down wisdom to the young, but there's a huge benefit
to flipping that around and allowing the novice
to teach the master. 00:09[The Way We Work] 00:12[Made possible
with the support of Dropbox] 00:14The workforce currently consists
of up to five generations and it's becoming more diverse across all spectrums
of underrepresented groups. But that change
is not arriving nearly as fast in C-suites and in boardrooms. Which means there's a growing gap between leaders and their people in regards to their
perspectives and experiences. 00:30Our organizations can fall
right through that gap into the trap of stale
thinking, blind spots and having policies that could alienate these underrepresented groups, not only in regards to age, race or gender, but all different kinds of viewpoints. 00:45Reverse mentoring could be an antidote
to that tunnel vision. But making reverse mentoring work, isn't as simple as finding a mentor and pressing go. You have to be genuinely curious about learning from that individual. And you have to be intentional
about the relationship in order to make it valuable. 01:00I know this because I was asked just a year into my career
at Virgin Atlantic to be the first ever reverse mentor to mentor CEO Craig Kreeger. I'd met Craig a few times and presented to him in meetings, but this, it was a whole
different ball game. Craig had revealed
that he had no black women in his inner circle and he was keen
to understand my perspective on how to build a more inclusive
culture at Virgin Atlantic. No pressure. Here's what I learned about how to make reverse mentoring work. 01:26Lesson one, make your match thoughtfully. Find someone who has a pulse on the key spokespeople
in the organization to help you make your match. This doesn't have to be
someone in human resources, just someone who knows you
and your teams well, because chemistry really matters. The VP of people experience chose me because I was open to sharing my ideas and also my enthusiasm
for leadership development. 01:46Also make sure that your mentor isn't a direct report
or part of your team, because it will be really difficult
to elicit honest feedback from someone who you also have to review at the end of the year. If you're in finance, find someone creative in marketing, or if you're in engineering,
find someone in customer service. This will ensure
that you develop perspectives from outside of your immediate team and different perspectives
make better leaders. 02:09Lesson two, to make things simple,
set some ground rules. The first meeting should be offsite
in a neutral location. If you're the mentee,
you should set the agenda. What is it that you really want to learn? Maybe you'd like to understand your mentor's career journey or perhaps whether
they've had any major obstacles they've had to overcome, or maybe you'd like to understand how specific company policies impact them either directly or indirectly. 02:32Agree that your conversations together will be confidential and whether there are any topics
which are off limits, such as family life or specific feedback on individuals. 02:41Lesson three, start with an icebreaker. I like to think of this as a long elevator pitch
of your life stories. Who are you? Poignant moments in your life. What are your hopes and dreams? Pivot to seek differences
and not similarities because that's the real power
of reverse mentoring. Craig and I found that we had formative
experiences in common. Both of us immigrants, him a second generation
growing up in the US and myself first generation arriving in the UK from Jamaica at the age of three. But from there, our stories are quite different. 03:11Lesson four, beware of role reversion. There were a few times in our conversation where Craig slipped
into giving me career advice. And I had to say,
""Craig this is really interesting and I'd love to come back to this later, but in our limited time together, is there anything else you'd
like to understand from me?"" Now this was quite hard, but you have to remember that as a mentor for this very short period of time, your insights are actually more valuable
to the organization. 03:33Lesson five, make time for reflection. Agree the key takeaways
from each of the sessions, either at the end
or through follow-up email and schedule your sessions to allow time between for reflection. We found that three to four weeks
provided a great rhythm. 03:47And finally, give credit where credit's due. In the traditional mentoring relationship the mentor isn't expected
to be given credit. However, in reverse mentoring where the mentee actually
holds a lot of the power accurate credit really counts. 04:02Forward-thinking organizations use reverse mentoring as one of the tools to help them build
a more inclusive environment. And studies have shown that when organizations
embrace reverse mentoring members of those underrepresented groups feel more confident
in sharing their perspectives. And when accompanied
by a comprehensive diversity and inclusion strategy, it leads to higher retention
amongst these groups. 04:23Personally, I found that my reverse mentoring
relationship with Craig enabled me to have a sense
of ownership and leadership in building an inclusive
culture at Virgin. And for Craig, it showed that even when you're
at the pinnacle of your career, there's still more you can learn."

laws were written on clay tablets in ancient Mesopotamia
around 2000 BCE. Formally or informally, human societies 
across place and time have made rules 
to bind and dissolve couples. Inca couples, for example,
started with a trial partnership, during which a man could send 
his partner home. But once a marriage was formalized,
there was no getting out of it. Among the Inuit peoples, 
divorce was discouraged, but either spouse could demand one. or they could exchange partners
with a different couple— as long as all four people agreed. 00:51The stakes of who can obtain a divorce,
and why, have always been high. Divorce is a battlefield for some
of society's most urgent issues, including the roles of church and state,
individual rights, and women’s rights. 01:06Religious authorities have often
regulated marriage and divorce. Muslims in Africa, the Middle East, and
Asia began using the Quran’s rules in the 7th century AD— generally, a husband can divorce his wife 
without cause or agreement, while a wife must secure her husband’s
agreement to divorce him. In Europe, Christian churches controlled
divorce from the 11th century on, with the Catholic Church
banning it entirely and Protestant churches allowing
it in restricted circumstances, particularly adultery. 01:40In the late 18th century,
a series of changes took place that would eventually shape 
divorce laws around the world. Following centuries of religious conflict, Europeans pushed for state governance
separate from religious control. Secular courts gradually took over
education, welfare, health, marriage— and divorce. The French Revolution ushered in the first
of the new divorce laws, allowing men and women to divorce 
for a number of grounds, including adultery, violence, 
and desertion, or simply mutual consent. 02:18Though progress was uneven, overall this
sort of legislation spread in Europe, North America and some European
colonies in the 19th century. Still, women's access to divorce often
remained restricted compared to men. Adultery was considered more
serious for women— a man could divorce his wife
for adultery alone, while a woman would need
evidence of adultery, plus an additional offense
to divorce her husband. Sometimes this double standard
was written into law; other times, the courts enforced
the laws unequally. Domestic violence by a man against 
his wife was not widely considered grounds for divorce 
until the 20th century. And though new laws expanded 
the reasons a couple could divorce, they also retained the fundamental
ideology of their religious predecessors: that a couple could only split if one
person wronged the other in specific ways. 03:18This state of affairs really overstayed
its welcome. Well into the 20th century,
couples in the U.S. resorted to hiring actors to jump into bed
with one spouse, fully clothed, and take photos
as evidence of cheating. Finally, in the 1960s and 70s, many countries and states adopted 
no-fault divorce laws, where someone could divorce their spouse 
without proving harm, and importantly, 
without the other’s consent. 03:50The transition from cultural 
and religious rules to state sanctioned ones 
has always been messy and incomplete— people have often ignored
their governments’ laws in favor of other conventions. Even today, the Catholic Church doesn’t 
recognize divorces granted by law. In some places, like parts of India, Western-style divorce laws
have been seen as a colonial influence and communities practice divorce 
according to other religious rules. In others, though the law may allow
for equal access to divorce, bias in the legal system, cultural stigma,
or community pressures can make it far more difficult for certain
people, almost always women. And even in the places where women 
aren’t disadvantaged by law or otherwise, social and economic conditions often make
divorce more difficult for women. In the United States, for example, women experience economic loss 
far more than men after divorce. 04:54At its best, modern no-fault divorce
allows people to leave marriages that make them unhappy. But dissolving a marriage 
is almost never as simple as sending two people their separate ways. What divorcing partners owe each other, and how they manage aspects 
of a once shared life remain emotionally and philosophically 
complex issues."
1,Beautiful new words to describe obscure emotions,John Koenig,Mar 2017,"John Koenig loves finding words that express our unarticulated feelings -- like ""lachesism,"" the hunger for disaster, and ""sonder,"" the realization that everyone else's lives are as complex and unknowable as our own.

about the meaning of words, how we define them and how they, almost as revenge, define us. 00:09The English language
is a magnificent sponge. I love the English language.
I'm glad that I speak it. But for all that, it has a lot of holes. In Greek, there's a word, ""lachesism"" which is the hunger for disaster. You know, when you see
a thunderstorm on the horizon and you just find yourself
rooting for the storm. In Mandarin, they have a word ""yù yī"" -- I'm not pronouncing that correctly -- which means the longing
to feel intensely again the way you did when you were a kid. In Polish, they have a word ""jouska"" which is the kind of
hypothetical conversation that you compulsively
play out in your head. And finally, in German,
of course in German, they have a word called ""zielschmerz"" which is the dread
of getting what you want. 01:03(Laughter) 01:08Finally fulfilling a lifelong dream. I'm German myself,
so I know exactly what that feels like. 01:15Now, I'm not sure
if I would use any of these words as I go about my day, but I'm really glad they exist. But the only reason they exist
is because I made them up. 01:25I am the author of ""The Dictionary
of Obscure Sorrows,"" which I've been writing
for the last seven years. And the whole mission of the project is to find holes
in the language of emotion and try to fill them so that we have a way of talking
about all those human peccadilloes and quirks of the human condition that we all feel
but may not think to talk about because we don't have the words to do it. 01:53And about halfway through this project, I defined ""sonder,"" the idea that we all think of ourselves
as the main character and everyone else is just extras. But in reality,
we're all the main character, and you yourself are an extra
in someone else's story. And so as soon as I published that, I got a lot of response from people saying, ""Thank you for giving voice
to something I had felt all my life but there was no word for that."" So it made them feel less alone. That's the power of words, to make us feel less alone. 02:32And it was not long after that that I started to notice sonder being used earnestly
in conversations online, and not long after I actually noticed it, I caught it next to me
in an actual conversation in person. There is no stranger feeling
than making up a word and then seeing it
take on a mind of its own. I don't have a word
for that yet, but I will. 02:55(Laughter) 02:57I'm working on it. 02:59I started to think
about what makes words real, because a lot of people ask me, the most common thing
I got from people is, ""Well, are these words made up?
I don't really understand."" And I didn't really know what to tell them because once sonder started to take off, who am I to say what words
are real and what aren't. And so I sort of felt like Steve Jobs,
who described his epiphany as when he realized that most of us,
as we go through the day, we just try to avoid
bouncing against the walls too much and just sort of get on with things. But once you realize that people -- that this world was built
by people no smarter than you, then you can reach out
and touch those walls and even put your hand through them and realize that you have
the power to change it. 03:47And when people ask me,
""Are these words real?"" I had a variety of answers
that I tried out. Some of them made sense.
Some of them didn't. But one of them I tried out was, ""Well, a word is real
if you want it to be real."" The way that this path is real
because people wanted it to be there. 04:04(Laughter) 04:06It happens on college
campuses all the time. It's called a ""desire path."" 04:09(Laughter) 04:10But then I decided,
what people are really asking when they're asking if a word is real,
they're really asking, ""Well, how many brains
will this give me access to?"" Because I think that's
a lot of how we look at language. A word is essentially a key that gets us into certain people's heads. And if it gets us into one brain, it's not really worth it, not really worth knowing. Two brains, eh, it depends on who it is. A million brains, OK, now we're talking. And so a real word is one that gets you
access to as many brains as you can. That's what makes it worth knowing. 04:50Incidentally, the realest word of all
by this measure is this. 04:54[O.K.] 04:56That's it. The realest word we have. That is the closest thing we have
to a master key. That's the most commonly
understood word in the world, no matter where you are. The problem with that is, no one seems to know
what those two letters stand for. 05:09(Laughter) 05:11Which is kind of weird, right? I mean, it could be a misspelling
of ""all correct,"" I guess, or ""old kinderhook."" No one really seems to know,
but the fact that it doesn't matter says something about
how we add meaning to words. The meaning is not
in the words themselves. We're the ones
that pour ourselves into it. 05:33And I think, when we're all searching
for meaning in our lives, and searching for the meaning of life, I think words have
something to do with that. And I think if you're looking
for the meaning of something, the dictionary is a decent place to start. It brings a sense of order to a very chaotic universe. Our view of things is so limited that we have to come up
with patterns and shorthands and try to figure out
a way to interpret it and be able to get on with our day. We need words to contain us,
to define ourselves. 06:09I think a lot of us feel boxed in by how we use these words. We forget that words are made up. It's not just my words.
All words are made up, but not all of them mean something. We're all just sort of
trapped in our own lexicons that don't necessarily correlate
with people who aren't already like us, and so I think I feel us drifting apart
a little more every year, the more seriously we take words. 06:39Because remember, words are not real. They don't have meaning. We do. 06:46And I'd like to leave you with a reading from one of my favorite philosophers, Bill Watterson, who created
""Calvin and Hobbes."" He said, ""Creating a life that reflects
your values and satisfies your soul is a rare achievement. To invent your own life's meaning is not easy, but it is still allowed, and I think you'll be
happier for the trouble."" 07:11Thank you. 07:12(Applause)"
1,What emotions look like in a dog's brain,Gregory Berns,Jul 2019,"How do dogs feel about their owners? In this talk, neuroscientist Dr. Gregory Berns explains how advanced brain imaging technologies could help us answer better understand the emotional bonds that exist between humans and our canine companions.", (87K),"Transcript (5 Languages)EnglishPortuguês brasileiroРусскийעבריתالعربيةQueenie Lee, Translator00:17How many of you are dog people? A show of hands. Excellent! How about cat people? OK, you guys can go to the break early. (Laughter) So, of the dog people and the cat people
who want to be dog people, (Laughter) how many of you have thought, ""Wouldn't it be great to know
what my dog is thinking?"" I think everyone else already knows
what their dog is thinking, right? I got into this project, and I'm going to tell you
a little bit about how - This is basically
a stupid dog trick story. It really started
with this dog named Newton, who was really my favorite dog. I've had many dogs through my life,
but Newton was my favorite, and he lived to be about 15 years old. After he passed away, I thought, I have these tools, this MRI machine,
that I have been using for decades to study human decision making
and what motivates people, why haven't we used this on other animals? Certainly, other animals have many of the same feelings
and motivations that people do. But this is kind of an area of science
that people don't like to talk about. So I embarked on this project
about four years ago to try to figure out what dogs think,
and specifically what dogs think of us. If we're talking about humans, we have kind of two ways we can think about what
other people are thinking: we can either ask them,
and sometimes they will tell us if they know, and they want us
to know what they are thinking; or we can observe actions,
we can observe behaviors, we can try to infer things about what
people are thinking from their actions. With animals, and dogs, of course,
we can't really ask them. We can ask them,
and we may think that they tell us, but we really don't know
what they're thinking. So we're kind of left
with their behaviors: we can observe their actions, and we can try to infer
what they are thinking. This is the foundation of behaviorism,
and it's been around since Pavlov. But there are, of course,
very tricky issues here, and humans being humans,
we tend to anthropomorphize everything. It's kind of in this area that I became very interested 
in intrigued with the possibility of trying to figure out what dogs
are thinking by using MRI. The technique is straightforward.
It's been around for decades. The idea is: if we were studying a human, we would put a human in an MRI,
have them do some type of task, and we'd measure blood flow
or brain activity and then try to figure out
what parts of the brain do what. Very straightforward,
if you've had an MRI, it's not terribly pleasant,
but people will do it. How do we do this with other animals?
How do we do it with a dog? I'm going to show you what we found.
 Here's a short video. It's a what we call our training video,
and it demonstrates how we did this. Before I start it, you're going to see
two dogs in this video. The first dog, Callie, is my dog. She was actually
the replacement for Newton. She was adopted here in Atlanta
from the Humane Society. We loved Newton so much;
we could never get another pug, so Callie is the anti-pug. The other dog is McKenzie,
a border collie. We just kind of get right into it. I'll narrate as we go along. [Callie - Introduction to head coil] This's Mark Spivak. He's my partner in this endeavor,
he's a dog trainer. The first thing that we had to do
 is figure out how do we get dogs
to go into a tube, to put a head coil around their head
to pick up the brain waves, and hold absolutely still. What you are seeing here, is that
Callie is not a particularly obedient dog; she has no particularly special skills. But she does have one very good trait,
and that is: she likes hot dogs. Mark is doing what we call
clicker training. Every time she approximates
what we want her to do, he clicks, and then she gets a hot dog. This's the very first time she's been introduced
to the thing we call the head coil, and we didn't know at this point
 whether this was even
going to be possible. [McKenzie - Introduction to head coil] This dog, McKenzie,
a border collie, is highly trained. She's very skilled in agility,
 and her owner, as you'll see,
gets her to sit in this coil very quickly. (Video) Dog owner: Good girl! Yes! Is she too far out now? (Video) Gregory Berns: Yeah, basically, we are looking for the brain case
to be in the center, right there. That's good. (On stage) GB: If you've had an MRI, you know that you're told
not to move, right? This is the big challenge of doing this. [Mckenzie - Holding without any chin rest] Up until this point, I didn't know if this was going
to be possible until I saw this. This was literally
after about five minutes of training. When I saw that, I knew we could do this. [Callie - Training with chin rest] What you saw McKenzie doing was close
but not quite good enough. What we are going after
 if we're to achieve data
that compares to humans - (Video) GB: You are perfect! 
Excellent! Perfect job! (On stage) GB: Mark told me
I had to be more demonstrative than I am normally. (Laughter) (Video) GB: Perfect! Yes! (Laughter) (On stage) GB: What you notice we did
was we introduced a little chin rest because we have to give the dogs
a target to put their head on. McKenzie adapts this very quickly. She's actually in a simulator
for an MRI that we built. She's doing quite well, but this is actually
still too much movement. The really difficult part of this
is the noise that the scanner makes, playing in the background. These are recordings that we made
to acclimate the dogs to the training. It's very loud. This's being played at low volume
just to get her used to it. But it's really about 95 decibels, and it's like jackhammer loud. (Video) GB: That's it,
that what we are doing! (On stage) GB: This is after
about a month or two of training. [Callie - Scammer training] We're at the real MRI now. This's probably the most expensive
training session ever performed. (Laughter) We get charged about 500 dollars
an hour to use the MRI. (Laughter) But we had to use the real thing
at a certain point. At this point, we didn't even know how
they would react to the magnetic field. The key thing I want you to notice is these dogs are doing it willingly,
and they enjoy it. That is the whole point of this project. We treat these animals
as family members. We don't sedate them,
and we don't restrain them. [Callie - Final training] This's actually after
about two months of training. We made some modifications
to the chin rest, and even a shelter dog
like Callie can do this. [Full chin rest, ear muffs,
tube, hand signals] If you look carefully, you also notice
that she's wearing ear muffs. It's very important because the scanner is so loud,
and the dogs hearing is quite sensitive. [This means ""hot dog""] The other thing that we did - (Laughter) This's a scientific experiment, really. (Laughter) [This means ""no hot dog""] That's the training video. The ""hot dog, no hot dog"" hand signals, we started with this because we didn't know
if this was going to work, so we decided we needed
to do something really simple. This's just straight up
Pavlovian conditioning where we taught the dogs
two hand signals: this means ""hot dog,""
and this means ""no hot dog."" If this technique works, what we should see is activity
in the reward system of their brain to this hand signal but not this signal. I also put up a slide here. Once we started doing this, the word got out amongst
the community here in Atlanta that we're doing this crazy
dog scanning project. We're looking for volunteers, especially people who like to train dogs
and have dogs that are very well behaved. That's still true. If you have a dog that can do this
or you think can do this, talk to me. Because the project is still going on,
and it's gotten quite large. You've seen the kind of preliminary video. This's one of my favorite photos
because it's kind of captures - this is the first day
we were actually doing the scanning. It captures the human confusion here. We were just standing around trying
to figure out how we are going to do this. But Callie knows, she's been trained,
she's been doing this for two months; so she's ready to go. The head wrap is just
to keep the ear muffs in place. This is what it look likes
from the other end, from the business end of the scanner. This's actually a dog named Zen.
He's a yellow lab golden retriever. What we're studying initially
is just the reward system response. Very simply, we got
these two hand signals, and the idea is we compare
the brain response to these two things. As I said, we have many dogs
doing this now, it's not just shelter dogs. We have dogs from
service dog organizations, we have shelter dogs -
really all sorts of breeds. Before I show you some of the results, I do want to say something
about brain anatomy. A dog brain - this slide is not to scale. A dog brain is probably about the size
of a plum or a lemon maybe, depending on the size of the dog. It's not big, even if you have a big dog, most of the head is muscle,
so just going to be aware of that. But I like putting up this slide because it shows
the similarities of animal brains. You can immediately
make out common structures. You can see towards the right
that kind of pretty structure is the cerebellum that controls
various types of motor movement, and then below that,
there is the brainstem. The really the parts of the brain
that are different are what we call the cortex. That's the upper part, the folded part. The big differences between dog and human
have to do with the size of the cortex and how folded it is. What folding accomplishes is packing a lot more brain surface area
into a specific volume. Generally speaking, the more folded a brain,
the more surface area, the more brain power, if you will. There are lot of similarities,
and there are some differences. What I am particularly interested in
are the similarities. Because if we were to have a commonality
of experience with dogs, and other animals for that matter, we have to share the same
or similar brain structures. Darwin said this 150 years ago. What do the results look like? This's a very compact way
of summarizing an experiment which I showed you where the dogs
receive two different hand signals, and we've averaged the results over,
in this case, 12 dogs, I think though, we've done this
probably in over 20 dogs. The orange areas show
 what parts of the brain are more active
to this reward signal, this hot dog signal. What I want to emphasize is the brain response
is not directly to hot dogs, it's to the hand signal
that means hot dogs. You may think that's not a big deal;
it's still hot dogs. It's no surprise that dogs like hot dogs. But it is a big deal
because we train this signal; it's a symbolic representation
of a hot dog that the dog has learned and has learned
to recognize this meaning. The particular parts of the brain that are being active
are the reward system. There's kind of two hot spots. There's a headlight type picture. That's in an area of the brain
called the cortex nucleus. It's the area of the brain
that all mammals have, and it's the area that has the most
dopamine receptors in the brain. It's kind of the key center that links
reward and motivation with action. Normally, when that's active
in a human or any other animal, it means that something
important has happened, and the animal needs to do something. In this case it's quite simple
because they will just eat the hot dogs. Well, so what? So we proved that dog brains
like hot dogs. That was just the beginning. This started about four years ago, and we've since gone on
and done many other experiments. Most of the dogs in these pictures,
are still working with us in the project. We've done things looking at how their olfaction, 
or their sensory system for smell works, how they identify different people, and other dogs
in their household by smell. One of the things that we found
is that this reward system, the same part of the brain activates
when the dogs smell a familiar human, even if the human is not there. It shows that dogs
have representations of us of our identities that persist
when we are not there. When people ask me,
""Do dogs miss us when we are gone?"" I have to say yes because we find evidence
that they are remembering their humans, that they care about them, and that it's associated
with these reward responses. Is it still just hot dogs? To answer this question,
one of the other things that we did was we actually repeated
the experiment I showed you, where we show
the different hand signals. With one little twist:
we manipulate who gives the signals. Does it matter if the dog's
owner gives a signal? Or whether a stranger comes in
and gives the signal? Or even whether a computer
gives the signal? Because if you believe Pavlov,
and all the behaviorist who followed him, it really shouldn't matter, because any signal that indicates
an upcoming food treat is all the same, if animals and dogs
are just kind of robots. But in fact, we did find a difference. What's very interesting about it
is that not all dogs are the same. For example, my dog Callie
had a much greater response in that part of the brain when a stranger gave the signals
or even a computer as opposed to me! (Laughter) Other dogs in the project, some of the golden retrievers in the labs
can have had the opposite pattern, where their owners had really elicited
the strongest brain response. This is very interesting because what it does is it provides us with a neural biomarker
of the dog's personality profile. In fact, what we've done
is we've spun off a new project which we're very excited about. We've partnered with Canine Companions for Independence, which is the largest service dog training
organization in the United States. If you know anything about service dogs,
they're incredibly difficult to train. It's very expensive,
and there's a very low success rate. Roughly about 35% of dogs
that enter these programs to train to be assistance dogs
will succeed; the other 2/3 end up being released
and adopted to their puppy raisers. So we've partnered with CCI, and they're actually training their dogs
to do the MRI procedure. What we're going to do
is try to predict which of those dogs
will actually be good service dogs. I really love this project because it shows 
that even though we started this just as my silly example
of trying to understand what my dogs think,
and whether they love me, it's actually gotten much bigger. Dogs are special. They're the first domesticated animals. They have been with humans
since humans have been humans. When we look at their brains, it's almost like we
are looking back in time, and it's giving us a picture
of how the dog-human bond formed. Thank you. (Applause)"
1,How to speak up for yourself,Adam Galinsky,Nov 2016,"Speaking up is hard to do, even when you know you should. Learn how to assert yourself, navigate tricky social situations and expand your personal power with sage guidance from social psychologist Adam Galinsky.", (220K),"Transcript (31 Languages)Bahasa IndonesiaDeutschEesti keelEnglishEspañolFrançaisFrançais canadienItalianoLietuvių kalbaMagyarPortuguês brasileiroPortuguês de PortugalRomânăTiếng ViệtTürkçeČeštinaРусскийСрпски, Srpskiбългарскимакедонскиעבריתالعربيةاُردُوفارسىગુજરાતીతెలుగుქართული中文 (简体)中文 (繁體)日本語한국어FootnotesFootnotes00:01Speaking up is hard to do. I understood the true meaning
of this phrase exactly one month ago, when my wife and I became new parents. It was an amazing moment. It was exhilarating and elating, but it was also scary and terrifying. And it got particularly terrifying
when we got home from the hospital, and we were unsure whether our little baby boy was getting
enough nutrients from breastfeeding. And we wanted to call our pediatrician, but we also didn't want
to make a bad first impression or come across as a crazy,
neurotic parent. So we worried. And we waited. When we got to the doctor's office
the next day, she immediately gave him formula
because he was pretty dehydrated. Our son is fine now, and our doctor has reassured us
we can always contact her. But in that moment, I should've spoken up, but I didn't. 00:58But sometimes we speak up
when we shouldn't, and I learned that over 10 years ago
when I let my twin brother down. My twin brother
is a documentary filmmaker, and for one of his first films, he got an offer
from a distribution company. He was excited, and he was inclined to accept the offer. But as a negotiations researcher, I insisted he make a counteroffer, and I helped him craft the perfect one. And it was perfect -- it was perfectly insulting. The company was so offended, they literally withdrew the offer and my brother was left with nothing. 01:36And I've asked people all over the world
about this dilemma of speaking up: when they can assert themselves, when they can push their interests, when they can express an opinion, when they can make an ambitious ask. 01:48And the range of stories
are varied and diverse, but they also make up
a universal tapestry. Can I correct my boss
when they make a mistake? Can I confront my coworker
who keeps stepping on my toes? Can I challenge my friend's
insensitive joke? Can I tell the person I love the most
my deepest insecurities? 02:10footnotefootnoteAnd through these experiences,
I've come to recognize that each of us have something called
a range of acceptable behavior. Now, sometimes we're too strong;
we push ourselves too much. That's what happened with my brother. Even making an offer was outside
his range of acceptable behavior. But sometimes we're too weak. That's what happened with my wife and I. And this range of acceptable behaviors -- when we stay within our range,
we're rewarded. When we step outside that range,
we get punished in a variety of ways. We get dismissed or demeaned
or even ostracized. Or we lose that raise
or that promotion or that deal. 02:49footnotefootnoteNow, the first thing we need to know is: What is my range? But the key thing is,
our range isn't fixed; it's actually pretty dynamic. It expands and it narrows
based on the context. And there's one thing that determines
that range more than anything else, and that's your power. Your power determines your range. What is power? Power comes in lots of forms. In negotiations, it comes
in the form of alternatives. So my brother had no alternatives; he lacked power. The company had lots of alternatives; they had power. Sometimes it's being new
to a country, like an immigrant, or new to an organization or new to an experience, like my wife and I as new parents. Sometimes it's at work, where someone's the boss
and someone's the subordinate. Sometimes it's in relationships, where one person's more invested
than the other person. 03:43And the key thing is that when
we have lots of power, our range is very wide. We have a lot of leeway in how to behave. But when we lack power, our range narrows. We have very little leeway. The problem is that when
our range narrows, that produces something called
the low-power double bind. The low-power double bind happens when, if we don't speak up,
we go unnoticed, but if we do speak up, we get punished. 04:13footnotefootnoteNow, many of you have heard
the phrase the ""double bind"" and connected it with one thing,
and that's gender. The gender double bind is women
who don't speak up go unnoticed, and women who do speak up get punished. And the key thing is that women have
the same need as men to speak up, but they have barriers to doing so. But what my research has shown
over the last two decades is that what looks
like a gender difference is not really a gender double bind, it's a really a low-power double bind. And what looks like a gender difference are really often just power
differences in disguise. Oftentimes we see a difference
between a man and a woman or men and women, and think, ""Biological cause.
There's something fundamentally different about the sexes."" But in study after study, I've found that a better explanation
for many sex differences is really power. And so it's the low-power double bind. And the low-power double bind
means that we have a narrow range, and we lack power. We have a narrow range, and our double bind is very large. 05:22So we need to find ways
to expand our range. And over the last couple decades, my colleagues and I have found
two things really matter. The first: you seem powerful
in your own eyes. The second: you seem powerful
in the eyes of others. When I feel powerful, I feel confident, not fearful; I expand my own range. When other people see me as powerful, they grant me a wider range. So we need tools to expand
our range of acceptable behavior. And I'm going to give you
a set of tools today. Speaking up is risky, but these tools will lower
your risk of speaking up. 06:03footnotefootnoteThe first tool I'm going to give you
got discovered in negotiations in an important finding. On average, women make
less ambitious offers and get worse outcomes than men
at the bargaining table. But Hannah Riley Bowles
and Emily Amanatullah have discovered there's one situation
where women get the same outcomes as men and are just as ambitious. That's when they advocate for others. When they advocate for others, they discover their own range
and expand it in their own mind. They become more assertive. This is sometimes called
""the mama bear effect."" Like a mama bear defending her cubs, when we advocate for others,
we can discover our own voice. 06:50But sometimes, we have
to advocate for ourselves. How do we do that? One of the most important tools
we have to advocate for ourselves is something called perspective-taking. And perspective-taking is really simple: it's simply looking at the world
through the eyes of another person. It's one of the most important tools
we have to expand our range. When I take your perspective, and I think about what you really want, you're more likely to give me
what I really want. 07:21footnotefootnoteBut here's the problem: perspective-taking is hard to do. So let's do a little experiment. I want you all to hold
your hand just like this: your finger -- put it up. And I want you to draw
a capital letter E on your forehead as quickly as possible. OK, it turns out that we can
draw this E in one of two ways, and this was originally designed
as a test of perspective-taking. I'm going to show you two pictures of someone with an E on their forehead -- my former student, Erika Hall. And you can see over here, that's the correct E. I drew the E so it looks like
an E to another person. That's the perspective-taking E because it looks like an E
from someone else's vantage point. But this E over here
is the self-focused E. We often get self-focused. And we particularly get
self-focused in a crisis. 08:14footnotefootnoteI want to tell you
about a particular crisis. A man walks into a bank
in Watsonville, California. And he says, ""Give me $2,000, or I'm blowing the whole bank
up with a bomb."" Now, the bank manager
didn't give him the money. She took a step back. She took his perspective, and she noticed something
really important. He asked for a specific amount of money. 08:36So she said, ""Why did you ask for $2,000?"" 08:41And he said, ""My friend
is going to be evicted unless I get him $2,000 immediately."" 08:45And she said, ""Oh! You don't want
to rob the bank -- you want to take out a loan."" 08:50(Laughter) 08:51""Why don't you come back to my office, and we can have you
fill out the paperwork."" 08:55(Laughter) 08:57Now, her quick perspective-taking
defused a volatile situation. So when we take someone's perspective, it allows us to be ambitious
and assertive, but still be likable. 09:09Here's another way to be assertive
but still be likable, and that is to signal flexibility. Now, imagine you're a car salesperson,
and you want to sell someone a car. You're going to more likely make the sale
if you give them two options. Let's say option A: $24,000 for this car
and a five-year warranty. Or option B: $23,000 and a three-year warranty. My research shows that when you give
people a choice among options, it lowers their defenses, and they're more likely
to accept your offer. 09:42footnotefootnoteAnd this doesn't just
work with salespeople; it works with parents. When my niece was four, she resisted getting dressed
and rejected everything. But then my sister-in-law
had a brilliant idea. What if I gave my daughter a choice? This shirt or that shirt? OK, that shirt. This pant or that pant? OK, that pant. And it worked brilliantly. She got dressed quickly
and without resistance. 10:05When I've asked the question
around the world when people feel comfortable speaking up, the number one answer is: ""When I have social support
in my audience; when I have allies."" So we want to get allies on our side. How do we do that? Well, one of the ways is be a mama bear. When we advocate for others, we expand our range in our own eyes
and the eyes of others, but we also earn strong allies. 10:31footnotefootnoteAnother way we can earn strong allies,
especially in high places, is by asking other people for advice. When we ask others for advice,
they like us because we flatter them, and we're expressing humility. And this really works to solve
another double bind. And that's the self-promotion double bind. The self-promotion double bind is that if we don't advertise
our accomplishments, no one notices. And if we do, we're not likable. 11:01footnotefootnoteBut if we ask for advice
about one of our accomplishments, we are able to be competent
in their eyes but also be likeable. And this is so powerful it even works when you see it coming. There have been multiple times in life
when I have been forewarned that a low-power person has been given
the advice to come ask me for advice. I want you to notice
three things about this: First, I knew they were going
to come ask me for advice. Two, I've actually done research
on the strategic benefits of asking for advice. And three, it still worked! I took their perspective, I became more invested in their cause, I became more committed to them
because they asked for advice. 11:46Now, another time we feel
more confident speaking up is when we have expertise. Expertise gives us credibility. When we have high power,
we already have credibility. We only need good evidence. When we lack power,
we don't have the credibility. We need excellent evidence. 12:05And one of the ways
we can come across as an expert is by tapping into our passion. I want everyone in the next few days
to go up to friend of theirs and just say to them, ""I want you to describe
a passion of yours to me."" I've had people do this all over the world and I asked them, ""What did you notice
about the other person when they described their passion?"" And the answers are always the same. ""Their eyes lit up and got big."" ""They smiled a big beaming smile."" ""They used their hands all over -- I had to duck because their
hands were coming at me."" ""They talk quickly
with a little higher pitch."" 12:42(Laughter) 12:43""They leaned in
as if telling me a secret."" 12:45And then I said to them, ""What happened to you
as you listened to their passion?"" 12:50They said, ""My eyes lit up. I smiled. I leaned in."" 12:55When we tap into our passion, we give ourselves the courage,
in our own eyes, to speak up, but we also get the permission
from others to speak up. Tapping into our passion even works
when we come across as too weak. Both men and women get punished
at work when they shed tears. But Lizzie Wolf has shown that when
we frame our strong emotions as passion, the condemnation of our crying
disappears for both men and women. 13:28I want to end with a few words
from my late father that he spoke at my twin
brother's wedding. Here's a picture of us. My dad was a psychologist like me, but his real love and his real
passion was cinema, like my brother. And so he wrote a speech
for my brother's wedding about the roles we play
in the human comedy. 13:50And he said, ""The lighter your touch, the better you become at improving
and enriching your performance. Those who embrace their roles
and work to improve their performance grow, change and expand the self. Play it well, and your days will be mostly joyful."" 14:08What my dad was saying is that we've all been assigned
ranges and roles in this world. But he was also saying
the essence of this talk: those roles and ranges are constantly
expanding and evolving. 14:24So when a scene calls for it, be a ferocious mama bear and a humble advice seeker. Have excellent evidence and strong allies. Be a passionate perspective taker. And if you use those tools -- and each and every one of you
can use these tools -- you will expand your range
of acceptable behavior, and your days will be mostly joyful. 14:52Thank you. 14:53(Applause)"

for all of them. I was a home-birth midwife
throughout my 20s. Delivering babies taught me
valuable and sometimes surprising things, like how to start a car at 2am. when it's 10 degrees below zero. 00:25(Laughter) 00:26Or how to revive a father
who's fainted at the sight of blood. 00:30(Laughter) 00:31Or how to cut the umbilical cord just so, to make a beautiful belly button. 00:36But those aren't the things
that stuck with me or guided me when I stopped being a midwife
and started other jobs. What stuck with me was this bedrock belief that each one of us comes into this world
with a unique worth. When I looked into the face of a newborn, I caught a glimpse of that worthiness, that sense of unapologetic selfhood, that unique spark. I use the word ""soul""
to describe that spark, because it's the only word in English
that comes close to naming what each baby brought into the room. 01:20Every newborn was as singular
as a snowflake, a matchless mash-up of biology and ancestry and mystery. And then that baby grows up, and in order to fit into the family, to conform to the culture, to the community, to the gender, that little one begins to cover its soul, layer by layer. We're born this way, but -- 01:49(Laughter) 01:51But as we grow, a lot
of things happen to us that make us ... want to hide our soulful
eccentricities and authenticity. We've all done this. Everyone in this room is a former baby -- 02:07(Laughter) 02:08with a distinctive birthright. But as adults, we spend so much
of our time uncomfortable in our own skin, like we have ADD:
authenticity deficit disorder. But not those babies -- not yet. Their message to me was: uncover your soul and look for that soul-spark in everyone else. It's still there. 02:35And here's what I learned
from laboring women. Their message was about staying open, even when things are painful. A woman's cervix normally looks like this. It's a tight little muscle at the base of the uterus. And during labor,
it has to stretch from this to this. Ouch! If you fight against that pain, you just create more pain, and you block what wants to be born. 03:06I'll never forget the magic
that would happen when a woman stopped resisting the pain and opened. It was as if the forces
of the universe took notice and sent in a wave of help. I never forgot that message, and now, when difficult
or painful things happen to me in my life or my work, of course at first I resist them, but then I remember
what I learned from the mothers: stay open. Stay curious. Ask the pain what it's come to deliver. Something new wants to be born. 03:45And there was one more big soulful lesson, and that one I learned
from Albert Einstein. He wasn't at any of the births, but -- 03:52(Laughter) 03:53It was a lesson about time. At the end of his life,
Albert Einstein concluded that our normal, hamster-wheel
experience of life is an illusion. We run round and round, faster and faster, trying to get somewhere. And all the while, underneath surface time
is this whole other dimension where the past and the present
and the future merge and become deep time. And there's nowhere to get to. 04:30Albert Einstein called
this state, this dimension, ""only being."" And he said when he experienced it, he knew sacred awe. When I was delivering babies, I was forced off the hamster wheel. Sometimes I had to sit for days,
hours and hours, just breathing with the parents; just being. And I got a big dose of sacred awe. 04:57So those are the three lessons
I took with me from midwifery. One: uncover your soul. Two: when things get difficult
or painful, try to stay open. And three: every now and then,
step off your hamster wheel into deep time. 05:18Those lessons have served me
throughout my life, but they really served me recently, when I took on the most
important job of my life thus far. 05:30Two years ago, my younger sister
came out of remission from a rare blood cancer, and the only treatment left for her
was a bone marrow transplant. And against the odds,
we found a match for her, who turned out to be me. I come from a family of four girls, and when my sisters found out that
I was my sister's perfect genetic match, their reaction was, ""Really? You?"" 06:00(Laughter) 06:02""A perfect match for her?"" Which is pretty typical for siblings. In a sibling society,
there's lots of things. There's love and there's friendship
and there's protection. But there's also jealousy and competition and rejection and attack. In siblinghood, that's where we start
assembling many of those first layers that cover our soul. 06:30When I discovered I was my sister's match, I went into research mode. And I discovered that the premise of transplants
is pretty straightforward. You destroy all the bone marrow
in the cancer patient with massive doses of chemotherapy, and then you replace that marrow with several million healthy
marrow cells from a donor. And then you do everything you can to make sure that those new cells
engraft in the patient. I also learned that bone marrow
transplants are fraught with danger. If my sister made it
through the near-lethal chemotherapy, she still would face other challenges. My cells might attack her body. And her body might reject my cells. They call this rejection or attack, and both could kill her. 07:27Rejection. Attack. Those words had a familiar ring in the context of being siblings. My sister and I had
a long history of love, but we also had a long history
of rejection and attack, from minor misunderstandings
to bigger betrayals. We didn't have
the kind of the relationship where we talked about the deeper stuff; but, like many siblings and like people
in all kinds of relationships, we were hesitant to tell our truths, to reveal our wounds, to admit our wrongdoings. 08:05But when I learned about
the dangers of rejection or attack, I thought, it's time to change this. What if we left the bone marrow
transplant up to the doctors, but did something that we later came
to call our ""soul marrow transplant?"" What if we faced any pain
we had caused each other, and instead of rejection or attack, could we listen? Could we forgive? Could we merge? Would that teach our cells to do the same? 08:41To woo my skeptical sister,
I turned to my parents' holy text: the New Yorker Magazine. 08:47(Laughter) 08:49I sent her a cartoon from its pages as a way of explaining
why we should visit a therapist before having my bone marrow harvested
and transplanted into her body. Here it is. 09:03""I have never forgiven him for that thing
I made up in my head."" 09:07(Laughter) 09:10I told my sister we had probably been doing the same thing, carting around made-up stories
in our heads that kept us separate. And I told her that after the transplant, all of the blood flowing in her veins would be my blood, made from my marrow cells, and that inside the nucleus
of each of those cells is a complete set of my DNA. ""I will be swimming around in you
for the rest of your life,"" I told my slightly horrified sister. 09:45(Laughter) 09:47""I think we better clean up
our relationship."" 09:52A health crisis makes people
do all sorts of risky things, like quitting a job
or jumping out of an airplane and, in the case of my sister, saying ""yes"" to several therapy sessions, during which we got down to the marrow. We looked at and released years of stories and assumptions about each other and blame and shame until all that was left was love. 10:26People have said I was brave
to undergo the bone marrow harvest, but I don't think so. What felt brave to me was that other kind
of harvest and transplant, the soul marrow transplant, getting emotionally naked
with another human being, putting aside pride and defensiveness, lifting the layers and sharing with each other
our vulnerable souls. I called on those midwife lessons: uncover your soul. Open to what's scary and painful. Look for the sacred awe. 11:05Here I am with my marrow cells
after the harvest. That's they call it -- ""harvest,"" like it's some kind of bucolic
farm-to-table event -- 11:14(Laughter) 11:15Which I can assure you it is not. And here is my brave, brave sister receiving my cells. After the transplant, we began to spend
more and more time together. It was as if we were little girls again. The past and the present merged. We entered deep time. I left the hamster wheel of work and life to join my sister on that lonely island of illness and healing. We spent months together -- in the isolation unit, in the hospital and in her home. 11:58Our fast-paced society does not support or even value
this kind of work. We see it as a disruption
of real life and important work. We worry about the emotional drain
and the financial cost -- and, yes, there is a financial cost. But I was paid in the kind of currency our culture
seems to have forgotten all about. I was paid in love. I was paid in soul. I was paid in my sister. 12:32My sister said the year after transplant
was the best year of her life, which was surprising. She suffered so much. But she said life never tasted as sweet, and that because of the soul-baring and the truth-telling
we had done with each other, she became more unapologetically herself with everyone. She said things
she'd always needed to say. She did things she always wanted to do. The same happened for me. I became braver about being authentic
with the people in my life. I said my truths, but more important than that,
I sought the truth of others. 13:19It wasn't until
the final chapter of this story that I realized just how well
midwifery had trained me. After that best year of my sister's life, the cancer came roaring back, and this time there was nothing more
the doctors could do. They gave her just
a couple of months to live. 13:40The night before my sister died, I sat by her bedside. She was so small and thin. I could see the blood pulsing in her neck. It was my blood, her blood, our blood. When she died, part of me would die, too. 14:00I tried to make sense of it all, how becoming one with each other had made us more ourselves, our soul selves, and how by facing and opening
to the pain of our past, we'd finally been delivered to each other, and how by stepping out of time, we would now be connected forever. 14:26My sister left me with so many things, and I'm going to leave you now
with just one of them. You don't have to wait
for a life-or-death situation to clean up the relationships
that matter to you, to offer the marrow of your soul and to seek it in another. We can all do this. We can be like a new kind
of first responder, like the one to take
the first courageous step toward the other, and to do something or try to do something other than rejection or attack. We can do this with our siblings and our mates and our friends and our colleagues. We can do this with the disconnection and the discord all around us. We can do this for the soul of the world. 15:24Thank you. 15:25(Applause)"
1,Fifty shades of gay,iO Tillett Wright,Jan 2013,"iO Tillett Wright has photographed 2,000 people who consider themselves somewhere on the LGBTQ spectrum -- and asked many of them: Can you assign a percentage to how gay or straight you are?

Are they attractive? Are they a potential mate? Are they a potential networking opportunity? We do this little interrogation when we meet people to make a mental resume for them. What's your name? Where are you from? How old are you? What do you do? Then we get more personal with it. Have you ever had any diseases? Have you ever been divorced? Does your breath smell bad while you're answering my interrogation right now? What are you into? Who are you into? What gender do you like to sleep with? 00:35I get it. We are neurologically hardwired to seek out people like ourselves. We start forming cliques as soon as we're old enough to know what acceptance feels like. We bond together based on anything that we can -- music preference, race, gender, the block that we grew up on. We seek out environments that reinforce our personal choices. Sometimes, though, just the question ""what do you do?"" can feel like somebody's opening a tiny little box and asking you to squeeze yourself inside of it. Because the categories, I've found, are too limiting. The boxes are too narrow. And this can get really dangerous. 01:14So here's a disclaimer about me, though, before we get too deep into this. I grew up in a very sheltered environment. I was raised in downtown Manhattan in the early 1980s, two blocks from the epicenter of punk music. I was shielded from the pains of bigotry and the social restrictions of a religiously-based upbringing. Where I come from, if you weren't a drag queen or a radical thinker or a performance artist of some kind, you were the weirdo. (Laughter) It was an unorthodox upbringing, but as a kid on the streets of New York, you learn how to trust your own instincts, you learn how to go with your own ideas. 01:53So when I was six, I decided that I wanted to be a boy. I went to school one day and the kids wouldn't let me play basketball with them. They said they wouldn't let girls play. So I went home, and I shaved my head, and I came back the next day and I said, ""I'm a boy."" I mean, who knows, right? When you're six, maybe you can do that. I didn't want anyone to know that I was a girl, and they didn't. I kept up the charade for eight years. 02:16So this is me when I was 11. I was playing a kid named Walter in a movie called ""Julian Po."" I was a little street tough that followed Christian Slater around and badgered him. See, I was also a child actor, which doubled up the layers of the performance of my identity, because no one knew that I was actually a girl really playing a boy. In fact, no one in my life knew that I was a girl -- not my teachers at school, not my friends, not the directors that I worked with. Kids would often come up to me in class and grab me by the throat to check for an Adam's apple or grab my crotch to check what I was working with. When I would go to the bathroom, I would turn my shoes around in the stalls so that it looked like I was peeing standing up. At sleepovers I would have panic attacks trying to break it to girls that they didn't want to kiss me without outing myself. 03:05It's worth mentioning though that I didn't hate my body or my genitalia. I didn't feel like I was in the wrong body. I felt like I was performing this elaborate act. I wouldn't have qualified as transgender. If my family, though, had been the kind of people to believe in therapy, they probably would have diagnosed me as something like gender dysmorphic and put me on hormones to stave off puberty. But in my particular case, I just woke up one day when I was 14, and I decided that I wanted to be a girl again. Puberty had hit, and I had no idea what being a girl meant, and I was ready to figure out who I actually was. 03:38When a kid behaves like I did, they don't exactly have to come out, right? No one is exactly shocked. (Laughter) But I wasn't asked to define myself by my parents. When I was 15, and I called my father to tell him that I had fallen in love, it was the last thing on either of our minds to discuss what the consequences were of the fact that my first love was a girl. Three years later, when I fell in love with a man, neither of my parents batted an eyelash either. See, it's one of the great blessings of my very unorthodox childhood that I wasn't ever asked to define myself as any one thing at any point. I was just allowed to be me, growing and changing in every moment. 04:19So four, almost five years ago, Proposition 8, the great marriage equality debate, was raising a lot of dust around this country. And at the time, getting married wasn't really something I spent a lot of time thinking about. But I was struck by the fact that America, a country with such a tarnished civil rights record, could be repeating its mistakes so blatantly. And I remember watching the discussion on television and thinking how interesting it was that the separation of church and state was essentially drawing geographical boundaries throughout this country, between places where people believed in it and places where people didn't. And then, that this discussion was drawing geographical boundaries around me. 04:59If this was a war with two disparate sides, I, by default, fell on team gay, because I certainly wasn't 100 percent straight. At the time I was just beginning to emerge from this eight-year personal identity crisis zigzag that saw me go from being a boy to being this awkward girl that looked like a boy in girl's clothes to the opposite extreme of this super skimpy, over-compensating, boy-chasing girly-girl to finally just a hesitant exploration of what I actually was, a tomboyish girl who liked both boys and girls depending on the person. 05:35I had spent a year photographing this new generation of girls, much like myself, who fell kind of between-the-lines -- girls who skateboarded but did it in lacy underwear, girls who had boys' haircuts but wore girly nail polish, girls who had eyeshadow to match their scraped knees, girls who liked girls and boys who all liked boys and girls who all hated being boxed in to anything. I loved these people, and I admired their freedom, but I watched as the world outside of our utopian bubble exploded into these raging debates where pundits started likening our love to bestiality on national television. And this powerful awareness rolled in over me that I was a minority, and in my own home country, based on one facet of my character. I was legally and indisputably a second-class citizen. 06:27I was not an activist. I wave no flags in my own life. But I was plagued by this question: How could anyone vote to strip the rights of the vast variety of people that I knew based on one element of their character? How could they say that we as a group were not deserving of equal rights as somebody else? Were we even a group? What group? And had these people ever even consciously met a victim of their discrimination? Did they know who they were voting against and what the impact was? 06:57And then it occurred to me, perhaps if they could look into the eyes of the people that they were casting into second-class citizenship it might make it harder for them to do. It might give them pause. Obviously I couldn't get 20 million people to the same dinner party, so I figured out a way where I could introduce them to each other photographically without any artifice, without any lighting, or without any manipulation of any kind on my part. Because in a photograph you can examine a lion's whiskers without the fear of him ripping your face off. 07:31For me, photography is not just about exposing film, it's about exposing the viewer to something new, a place they haven't gone before, but most importantly, to people that they might be afraid of. Life magazine introduced generations of people to distant, far-off cultures they never knew existed through pictures. So I decided to make a series of very simple portraits, mugshots if you will. And I basically decided to photograph anyone in this country that was not 100 percent straight, which, if you don't know, is a limitless number of people. 08:05(Laughter) 08:07So this was a very large undertaking, and to do it we needed some help. So I ran out in the freezing cold, and I photographed every single person that I knew that I could get to in February of about two years ago. And I took those photographs, and I went to the HRC and I asked them for some help. And they funded two weeks of shooting in New York. And then we made this. 08:31(Music) 08:43Video: I'm iO Tillett Wright, and I'm an artist born and raised in New York City. (Music) 09:00Self Evident Truths is a photographic record of LGBTQ America today. My aim is to take a simple portrait of anyone who's anything other than 100 percent straight or feels like they fall in the LGBTQ spectrum in any way. My goal is to show the humanity that exists in every one of us through the simplicity of a face. (Music) 09:22""We hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created equal."" It's written in the Declaration of Independence. We are failing as a nation to uphold the morals upon which we were founded. There is no equality in the United States. 09:33[""What does equality mean to you?""] [""Marriage""] [""Freedom""] [""Civil rights""] [""Treat every person as you'd treat yourself""] 09:40It's when you don't have to think about it, simple as that. The fight for equal rights is not just about gay marriage. Today in 29 states, more than half of this country, you can legally be fired just for your sexuality. 09:54[""Who is responsible for equality?""] 09:58I've heard hundreds of people give the same answer: ""We are all responsible for equality."" So far we've shot 300 faces in New York City. And we wouldn't have been able to do any of it without the generous support of the Human Rights Campaign. I want to take the project across the country. I want to visit 25 American cities, and I want to shoot 4,000 or 5,000 people. This is my contribution to the civil rights fight of my generation. I challenge you to look into the faces of these people and tell them that they deserve less than any other human being. (Music) 10:28[""Self evident truths""] [""4,000 faces across America""] 10:32(Music) (Applause) 10:45iO Tillett Wright: Absolutely nothing could have prepared us for what happened after that. Almost 85,000 people watched that video, and then they started emailing us from all over the country, asking us to come to their towns and help them to show their faces. And a lot more people wanted to show their faces than I had anticipated. So I changed my immediate goal to 10,000 faces. That video was made in the spring of 2011, and as of today I have traveled to almost 20 cities and photographed almost 2,000 people. 11:18I know that this is a talk, but I'd like to have a minute of just quiet and have you just look at these faces because there is nothing that I can say that will add to them. Because if a picture is worth a thousand words, then a picture of a face needs a whole new vocabulary. 11:57So after traveling and talking to people in places like Oklahoma or small-town Texas, we found evidence that the initial premise was dead on. Visibility really is key. Familiarity really is the gateway drug to empathy. Once an issue pops up in your own backyard or amongst your own family, you're far more likely to explore sympathy for it or explore a new perspective on it. Of course, in my travels I met people who legally divorced their children for being other than straight, but I also met people who were Southern Baptists who switched churches because their child was a lesbian. Sparking empathy had become the backbone of Self Evident Truths. 12:37But here's what I was starting to learn that was really interesting: Self Evident Truths doesn't erase the differences between us. In fact, on the contrary, it highlights them. It presents, not just the complexities found in a procession of different human beings, but the complexities found within each individual person. It wasn't that we had too many boxes, it was that we had too few. 13:07At some point I realized that my mission to photograph ""gays"" was inherently flawed, because there were a million different shades of gay. Here I was trying to help, and I had perpetuated the very thing I had spent my life trying to avoid -- yet another box. At some point I added a question to the release form that asked people to quantify themselves on a scale of one to 100 percent gay. And I watched so many existential crises unfold in front of me. (Laughter) People didn't know what to do because they had never been presented with the option before. Can you quantify your openness? 13:46Once they got over the shock, though, by and large people opted for somewhere between 70 to 95 percent or the 3 to 20 percent marks. Of course, there were lots of people who opted for a 100 percent one or the other, but I found that a much larger proportion of people identified as something that was much more nuanced. I found that most people fall on a spectrum of what I have come to refer to as ""Grey."" 14:09Let me be clear though -- and this is very important -- in no way am I saying that preference doesn't exist. And I am not even going to address the issue of choice versus biological imperative, because if any of you happen to be of the belief that sexual orientation is a choice, I invite you to go out and try to be grey. I'll take your picture just for trying. (Laughter) What I am saying though is that human beings are not one-dimensional. The most important thing to take from the percentage system is this: If you have gay people over here and you have straight people over here, and while we recognize that most people identify as somewhere closer to one binary or another, there is this vast spectrum of people that exist in between. 14:59And the reality that this presents is a complicated one. Because, for example, if you pass a law that allows a boss to fire an employee for homosexual behavior, where exactly do you draw the line? Is it over here, by the people who have had one or two heterosexual experiences so far? Or is it over here by the people who have only had one or two homosexual experiences thus far? Where exactly does one become a second-class citizen? 15:26Another interesting thing that I learned from my project and my travels is just what a poor binding agent sexual orientation is. After traveling so much and meeting so many people, let me tell you, there are just as many jerks and sweethearts and Democrats and Republicans and jocks and queens and every other polarization you can possibly think of within the LGBT community as there are within the human race. Aside from the fact that we play with one legal hand tied behind our backs, and once you get past the shared narrative of prejudice and struggle, just being other than straight doesn't necessarily mean that we have anything in common. 16:08So in the endless proliferation of faces that Self Evident Truths is always becoming, as it hopefully appears across more and more platforms, bus shelters, billboards, Facebook pages, screen savers, perhaps in watching this procession of humanity, something interesting and useful will begin to happen. Hopefully these categories, these binaries, these over-simplified boxes will begin to become useless and they'll begin to fall away. Because really, they describe nothing that we see and no one that we know and nothing that we are. What we see are human beings in all their multiplicity. And seeing them makes it harder to deny their humanity. At the very least I hope it makes it harder to deny their human rights. 17:02So is it me particularly that you would choose to deny the right to housing, the right to adopt children, the right to marriage, the freedom to shop here, live here, buy here? Am I the one that you choose to disown as your child or your brother or your sister or your mother or your father, your neighbor, your cousin, your uncle, the president, your police woman or the fireman? It's too late. Because I already am all of those things. We already are all of those things, and we always have been. So please don't greet us as strangers, greet us as your fellow human beings, period. 17:45Thank you. 17:46(Applause)"

about the two biggest social trends in the coming century, and perhaps in the next 10,000 years. But I want to start
with my work on romantic love, because that's my most recent work. What I and my colleagues did was put
32 people, who were madly in love, into a functional MRI brain scanner. 17 who were madly in love
and their love was accepted; and 15 who were madly in love
and they had just been dumped. And so I want to tell you
about that first, and then go on into where
I think love is going. 00:36(Laughter) 00:38""What 'tis to love?"" Shakespeare said. I think our ancestors -- I think human beings have been
wondering about this question since they sat around their campfires or lay and watched
the stars a million years ago. I started out by trying to figure out
what romantic love was by looking at the last 45 years
of the psychological research and as it turns out, there's a very specific group of things
that happen when you fall in love. The first thing that happens is, a person begins to take on
what I call, ""special meaning."" As a truck driver once said to me, ""The world had a new center,
and that center was Mary Anne."" 01:21George Bernard Shaw said it differently. ""Love consists of overestimating
the differences between one woman and another."" And indeed, that's what we do. 01:30(Laughter) 01:33And then you just focus on this person. You can list what you
don't like about them, but then you sweep that aside
and focus on what you do. As Chaucer said, ""Love is blind."" 01:46In trying to understand romantic love, I decided I would read poetry
from all over the world, and I just want to give
you one very short poem from eighth-century China, because it's an almost perfect example of a man who is focused totally
on a particular woman. It's a little bit like when you are
madly in love with somebody and you walk into a parking lot -- their car is different
from every other car in the parking lot. Their wine glass at dinner is different from every other wine glass
at the dinner party. And in this case, a man got hooked
on a bamboo sleeping mat. 02:19And it goes like this. It's by a guy called Yuan Zhen. ""I cannot bear to put away
the bamboo sleeping mat. The night I brought you home,
I watched you roll it out."" He became hooked on a sleeping mat, probably because of elevated activity
of dopamine in his brain, just like with you and me. 02:37But anyway, not only does this person
take on special meaning, you focus your attention on them. You aggrandize them. But you have intense energy. As one Polynesian said,
""I felt like jumping in the sky."" You're up all night.
You're walking till dawn. You feel intense elation
when things are going well; mood swings into horrible despair
when things are going poorly. Real dependence on this person. As one businessman in New York said to me, ""Anything she liked, I liked."" Simple. Romantic love is very simple. 03:10You become extremely sexually possessive. You know, if you're just sleeping
with somebody casually, you don't really care
if they're sleeping with somebody else. But the moment you fall in love, you become extremely
sexually possessive of them. I think there's a Darwinian
purpose to this. The whole point of this
is to pull two people together strongly enough to begin
to rear babies as a team. 03:33But the main characteristics
of romantic love are craving: an intense craving
to be with a particular person, not just sexually, but emotionally. It would be nice to go to bed with them, but you want them to call you
on the telephone, to invite you out, etc., to tell you that they love you. The other main characteristic
is motivation. The motor in the brain begins to crank,
and you want this person. 04:01And last but not least,
it is an obsession. Before I put these people
in the MRI machine, I would ask them all kinds of questions. But my most important question
was always the same. It was: ""What percentage of the day
and night do you think about this person?"" And indeed, they would say, ""All day. All night. I can never stop thinking
about him or her."" 04:25And then, the very last question -- I would always have to work
myself up to this question, because I'm not a psychologist. I don't work with people
in any kind of traumatic situation. My final question was always the same. I would say,
""Would you die for him or her?"" And, indeed, these people would say ""Yes!"" as if I had asked them to pass the salt. I was just staggered by it. 04:47So we scanned their brains, looking at a photograph
of their sweetheart and looking at a neutral photograph, with a distraction task in between. So we could look at the same brain
when it was in that heightened state and when it was in a resting state. And we found activity
in a lot of brain regions. In fact, one of the most important
was a brain region that becomes active
when you feel the rush of cocaine. And indeed, that's exactly what happens. 05:15I began to realize that romantic love
is not an emotion. In fact, I had always thought
it was a series of emotions, from very high to very low. But actually, it's a drive. It comes from the motor of the mind, the wanting part of the mind,
the craving part of the mind. The kind of part of the mind when you're reaching
for that piece of chocolate, when you want to win
that promotion at work. The motor of the brain. It's a drive. 05:43And in fact, I think it's more powerful
than the sex drive. You know, if you ask somebody
to go to bed with you, and they say, ""No, thank you,"" you certainly don't kill yourself
or slip into a clinical depression. But certainly, around the world, people who are rejected
in love will kill for it. People live for love. They kill for love. They die for love. They have songs, poems, novels, sculptures, paintings, myths, legends. In over 175 societies, people have left their evidence
of this powerful brain system. I have come to think it's one of the most powerful
brain systems on Earth for both great joy and great sorrow. 06:27And I've also come to think that it's one of three
basically different brain systems that evolved from mating and reproduction. One is the sex drive:
the craving for sexual gratification. W.H. Auden called it
an ""intolerable neural itch,"" and indeed, that's what it is. It keeps bothering you
a little bit, like being hungry. The second of these three brain
systems is romantic love: that elation, obsession of early love. And the third brain system is attachment: that sense of calm and security
you can feel for a long-term partner. 07:00And I think that the sex drive
evolved to get you out there, looking for a whole range of partners. You can feel it when you're just
driving along in your car. It can be focused on nobody. I think romantic love evolved
to enable you to focus your mating energy on just one individual at a time, thereby conserving mating time and energy. And I think that attachment,
the third brain system, evolved to enable you to tolerate
this human being at least long enough to raise
a child together as a team. So with that preamble, I want to go into discussing
the two most profound social trends. One of the last 10,000 years and the other,
certainly of the last 25 years, that are going to have an impact
on these three different brain systems: lust, romantic love
and deep attachment to a partner. 07:54The first is women working,
moving into the workforce. I've looked at 130 societies through the demographic yearbooks
of the United Nations. Everywhere in the world,
129 out of 130 of them, women are not only moving
into the job market -- sometimes very, very slowly,
but they are moving into the job market -- and they are very slowly closing
that gap between men and women in terms of economic power,
health and education. It's very slow. 08:26For every trend on this planet,
there's a counter-trend. We all know of them, but nevertheless -- the Arabs say, ""The dogs may bark,
but the caravan moves on."" And, indeed, that caravan is moving on. Women are moving back into the job market. And I say back into the job market,
because this is not new. For millions of years,
on the grasslands of Africa, women commuted to work
to gather their vegetables. They came home with 60 to 80 percent
of the evening meal. The double income family was the standard. And women were regarded
as just as economically, socially and sexually powerful as men. In short, we're really
moving forward to the past. 09:12Then, women's worst
invention was the plow. With the beginning of plow agriculture,
men's roles became extremely powerful. Women lost their ancient
jobs as collectors, but then with the industrial revolution
and the post-industrial revolution they're moving back into the job market. In short, they are acquiring the status
that they had a million years ago, 10,000 years ago, 100,000 years ago. We are seeing now one
of the most remarkable traditions in the history of the human animal. And it's going to have an impact. 09:50I generally give a whole lecture on the impact of women
on the business community. I'll say just a couple of things,
and then go on to sex and love. There's a lot of gender differences; anybody who thinks men and women are alike simply never had a boy and a girl child. I don't know why they want to think
that men and women are alike. There's much we have in common, but there's a whole lot
that we do not have in common. 10:11We are -- in the words of Ted Hughes, ""I think that we are like two feet.
We need each other to get ahead."" But we did not evolve
to have the same brain. And we're finding more and more
gender differences in the brain. I'll only just use a couple
and then move on to sex and love. One of them is women's verbal ability. Women can talk. 10:31Women's ability to find the right word
rapidly, basic articulation goes up in the middle
of the menstrual cycle, when estrogen levels peak. But even at menstruation,
they're better than the average man. Women can talk. They've been doing it for a million years;
words were women's tools. They held that baby
in front of their face, cajoling it, reprimanding it,
educating it with words. And, indeed, they're becoming
a very powerful force. 10:57Even in places like India and Japan, where women are not moving rapidly
into the regular job market, they're moving into journalism. And I think that the television
is like the global campfire. We sit around it and it shapes our minds. Almost always, when I'm on TV,
the producer who calls me, who negotiates what we're going to say, is a woman. In fact, Solzhenitsyn once said, ""To have a great writer
is to have another government."" 11:29Today 54 percent of people
who are writers in America are women. It's one of many, many
characteristics that women have that they will bring into the job market. They've got incredible people skills,
negotiating skills. They're highly imaginative. We now know the brain circuitry
of imagination, of long-term planning. They tend to be web thinkers. Because the female parts
of the brain are better connected, they tend to collect more
pieces of data when they think, put them into more complex patterns,
see more options and outcomes. They tend to be contextual,
holistic thinkers, what I call web thinkers. 12:08Men tend to -- and these are averages -- tend to get rid of what they regard
as extraneous, focus on what they do, and move in a more
step-by-step thinking pattern. They're both perfectly good
ways of thinking. We need both of them to get ahead. In fact, there's many more
male geniuses in the world. And there's also many more
male idiots in the world. 12:31(Laughter) 12:33When the male brain works well,
it works extremely well. And what I really think
that we're doing is, we're moving towards
a collaborative society, a society in which the talents
of both men and women are becoming understood
and valued and employed. 12:49But in fact, women moving
into the job market is having a huge impact
on sex and romance and family life. Foremost, women are starting
to express their sexuality. I'm always astonished
when people come to me and say, ""Why is it that men are so adulterous?"" ""Why do you think
more men are adulterous than women?"" ""Well, men are more adulterous!"" And I say, ""Who do you think
these men are sleeping with?"" 13:15(Laughter) 13:16And -- basic math! 13:18Anyway. In the Western world, women start sooner at sex,
have more partners, express less remorse
for the partners that they do, marry later, have fewer children, leave bad marriages
in order to get good ones. We are seeing the rise
of female sexual expression. And, indeed, once again we're moving
forward to the kind of sexual expression that we probably saw on the grasslands
of Africa a million years ago, because this is the kind
of sexual expression that we see in hunting and gathering societies today. 13:52We're also returning
to an ancient form of marriage equality. They're now saying that the 21st century is going to be the century of what
they call the ""symmetrical marriage,"" or the ""pure marriage,""
or the ""companionate marriage."" This is a marriage between equals, moving forward to a pattern that is highly compatible
with the ancient human spirit. 14:21We're also seeing a rise of romantic love. 91 percent of American women
and 86 percent of American men would not marry somebody
who had every single quality they were looking for in a partner, if they were not in love with that person. People around the world,
in a study of 37 societies, want to be in love
with the person that they marry. Indeed, arranged marriages are
on their way off this braid of human life. 14:55I even think that marriages
might even become more stable because of the second great world trend. The first one being women
moving into the job market, the second one being
the aging world population. They're now saying that in America, that middle age should be regarded
as up to age 85. Because in that highest
age category of 76 to 85, as much as 40 percent of people
have nothing really wrong with them. So we're seeing there's a real
extension of middle age. 15:26For one of my books,
I looked at divorce data in 58 societies. And as it turns out, the older you get,
the less likely you are to divorce. So the divorce rate right now
is stable in America, and it's actually beginning to decline. It may decline some more. I would even say that with Viagra, estrogen replacement, hip replacements and the incredibly interesting women -- women have never been
as interesting as they are now. Not at any time on this planet
have women been so educated, so interesting, so capable. And so I honestly think that if there
really was ever a time in human evolution when we have the opportunity to make
good marriages, that time is now. 16:16However, there's always kinds
of complications in this. These three brain systems --
lust, romantic love and attachment -- don't always go together. They can go together, by the way. That's why casual sex isn't so casual. With orgasm you get a spike of dopamine. Dopamine's associated with romantic love, and you can just
fall in love with somebody who you're just having casual sex with. With orgasm, then you get a real rush
of oxytocin and vasopressin -- those are associated with attachment. This is why you can feel such a sense
of cosmic union with somebody after you've made love to them. 16:49But these three brain systems:
lust, romantic love and attachment, aren't always connected to each other. You can feel deep attachment
to a long-term partner while you feel intense
romantic love for somebody else, while you feel the sex drive for people
unrelated to these other partners. In short, we're capable of loving
more than one person at a time. In fact, you can lie in bed at night and swing from deep feelings
of attachment for one person to deep feelings
of romantic love for somebody else. It's as if there's a committee meeting
going on in your head as you are trying to decide what to do. So I don't think, honestly, we're an animal
that was built to be happy; we are an animal
that was built to reproduce. I think the happiness we find, we make. And I think, however, we can make good relationships
with each other. 17:46So I want to conclude with two things. I want to conclude with a worry, and with a wonderful story. The worry is about antidepressants. Over 100 million prescriptions
of antidepressants are written every year
in the United States. And these drugs are going generic. They are seeping around the world. I know one girl who's been
on these antidepressants, SSRIs, serotonin-enhancing
antidepressants -- since she was 13. She's 23. She's been on them
ever since she was 13. 18:25I've got nothing against people
who take them short term, when they're going
through something horrible. They want to commit suicide
or kill somebody else. I would recommend it. But more and more people
in the United States are taking them long term. And indeed, what these drugs do
is raise levels of serotonin. And by raising levels of serotonin,
you suppress the dopamine circuit. Everybody knows that. Dopamine is associated with romantic love. Not only do they suppress
the dopamine circuit, but they kill the sex drive. And when you kill the sex drive,
you kill orgasm. And when you kill orgasm, you kill that flood of drugs
associated with attachment. The things are connected in the brain. And when you tamper with one brain system, you're going to tamper with another. I'm just simply saying that a world
without love is a deadly place. 19:24So now -- 19:25(Applause) 19:30Thank you. 19:31I want to end with a story. And then, just a comment. I've been studying romantic love
and sex and attachment for 30 years. I'm an identical twin;
I am interested in why we're all alike. Why you and I are alike,
why the Iraqis and the Japanese and the Australian Aborigines
and the people of the Amazon River are all alike. And about a year ago, an Internet dating service,
Match.com, came to me and asked me if I would design
a new dating site for them. I said, ""I don't know anything
about personality. You know? I don't know. Do you think
you've got the right person?"" They said, ""Yes."" It got me thinking
about why it is that you fall in love with one person rather than another. 20:16That's my current project;
it will be my next book. There's all kinds of reasons that you fall in love
with one person rather than another. Timing is important.
Proximity is important. Mystery is important. You fall in love with somebody
who's somewhat mysterious, in part because mystery
elevates dopamine in the brain, probably pushes you
over that threshold to fall in love. You fall in love with somebody who fits within
what I call your ""love map,"" an unconscious list of traits that you build in childhood
as you grow up. And I also think
that you gravitate to certain people, actually, with somewhat
complementary brain systems. And that's what I'm now
contributing to this. 20:54But I want to tell you
a story, to illustrate. I've been carrying on here
about the biology of love. I wanted to show you a little bit
about the culture of it, too, the magic of it. It's a story that was told to me by somebody who had
heard it just from one -- probably a true story. It was a graduate student --
I'm at Rutgers and my two colleagues -- Art Aron is at SUNY Stony Brook. That's where we put our people
in the MRI machine. 21:25And this graduate student was madly
in love with another graduate student, and she was not in love with him. And they were
all at a conference in Beijing. And he knew from our work that if you go and do something
very novel with somebody, you can drive up
the dopamine in the brain, and perhaps trigger
this brain system for romantic love. 21:49(Laughter) 21:51So he decided he'd put science to work. And he invited this girl to go off
on a rickshaw ride with him. 22:00And sure enough -- I've never been in one, but apparently they go
all around the buses and the trucks and it's crazy and it's noisy
and it's exciting. He figured that this
would drive up the dopamine, and she'd fall in love with him. So off they go and she's squealing
and squeezing him and laughing and having a wonderful time. An hour later they get down
off of the rickshaw, and she throws her hands up and she says, ""Wasn't that wonderful?"" And, ""Wasn't that rickshaw
driver handsome!"" 22:32(Laughter) 22:35(Applause) 22:42There's magic to love! 22:43(Applause) 22:44But I will end by saying
that millions of years ago, we evolved three basic drives: the sex drive, romantic love and attachment to a long-term partner. These circuits are deeply
embedded in the human brain. They're going to survive
as long as our species survives on what Shakespeare called
""this mortal coil."" 23:06Thank you. 23:07Chris Anderson: Helen Fisher! 23:08(Applause)"
1,What you don't know about marriage,Jenna McCarthy,Feb 2012,"In this funny, casual talk from TEDx, writer Jenna McCarthy shares surprising research on how marriages (especially happy marriages) really work. One tip: Do not try to win an Oscar for best actress.", (205K),"Transcript (38 Languages)Bahasa IndonesiaCatalàDeutschEnglishEspañolFrançaisFrançais canadienHrvatskiItalianoLietuvių kalbaMagyarNederlandsPolskiPortuguês brasileiroPortuguês de PortugalRomânăShqipSvenskaTiếng ViệtTürkçeČeštinaΕλληνικάРусскийСрпски, SrpskiУкраїнськабългарскимакедонскиҚазақ тіліעבריתالعربيةفارسىภาษาไทยမြန်မာဘာသာ中文 (简体)中文 (粵語)中文 (繁體)日本語한국어00:00Every year in the United States alone, 2,077,000 couples make
a legal and spiritual decision to spend the rest
of their lives together -- 00:13(Laughter) 00:15And not to have sex with anyone else. Ever. He buys a ring, she buys a dress. They go shopping for all sorts of things. She takes him to Arthur Murray
for ballroom-dancing lessons. And the big day comes. And they'll stand before God and family and some guy her dad
once did business with, and they'll vow that nothing -- not abject poverty, not life-threatening illness, not complete and utter misery -- will ever put the tiniest damper
on their eternal love and devotion. 00:56(Laughter) 00:58These optimistic young bastards
promise to honor and cherish each other through hot flashes and midlife crises and a cumulative 50-pound weight gain, until that far-off day, when one of them
is finally able to rest in peace. 01:17(Laughter) 01:18You know, because they can't hear
the snoring anymore. And then they'll get stupid drunk and smash cake in each other's faces
and do the Macarena. And we'll be there, showering them with towels and toasters
and drinking their free booze and throwing birdseed at them
every single time ... even though we know, statistically, half of them will be divorced
within a decade. 01:43(Laughter) 01:46Of course, the other half won't, right? They'll keep forgetting anniversaries and arguing about where to spend holidays and debating -- 01:55(Laughter) 01:56Which way the toilet paper
should come off of the roll. And some of them will even still
be enjoying each other's company when neither of them can chew
solid food anymore. 02:09And researchers want to know why. I mean, look -- it doesn't take
a double-blind, placebo-controlled study to figure out what makes
a marriage not work: disrespect, boredom, too much time on Facebook, having sex with other people. But you can have the exact
opposite of all of those things -- respect, excitement, a broken Internet connection, mind-numbing monogamy -- and the thing still can go
to hell in a handbasket. So, what's going on when it doesn't? What do the folks who make it all the way
to side-by-side burial plots have in common? What are they doing right? What can we learn from them? And if you're still happily sleeping solo, why should you stop what you're doing
and make it your life's work to find that one special person that you can annoy
for the rest of your life? 03:09Well, researchers spend
billions of your tax dollars trying to figure that out. They stalk blissful couples and study their every move and mannerism. And they try to pinpoint
what it is that sets them apart from their miserable
neighbors and friends. And it turns out, the success stories
share a few similarities, beyond that they don't have sex
with other people. 03:34For instance, in the happiest marriages, the wife is thinner and better-looking than the husband. 03:41(Laughter) 03:42Obvious. Right? It's obvious that this leads
to marital bliss, because women -- we care a great deal
about being thin and good-looking, whereas men mostly care about sex, ideally, with women who are thinner
and better looking than they are. The beauty of this research, though, is that no one is suggesting
that women have to be thin to be happy. We just have to be thinner
than our partners. So instead of all that laborious
dieting and exercising, we just need to wait
for them to get fat -- 04:13(Laughter) 04:14Maybe bake a few pies. This is good information to have,
and it's not that complicated. 04:20(Laughter) 04:21Research also suggests that the happiest couples are the ones
that focus on the positives. For example: the happy wife. Instead of pointing out
her husband's growing gut or suggesting he go for a run, she might say, ""Wow, honey, thank you
for going out of your way to make me relatively thinner."" 04:41(Laughter) 04:42These are couples
who can find good in any situation. ""Yeah, it was devastating
when we lost everything in that fire. But it's kind of nice sleeping
out here under the stars. And it's a good thing you've got
all that body fat to keep us warm."" 04:57(Laughter) 04:58One of my favorite studies found that the more willing
a husband is to do housework, the more attractive
his wife will find him. Because we needed a study to tell us this. 05:09(Laughter) 05:10But here's what's going on here. The more attractive she finds him,
the more sex they have; the more sex they have,
the nicer he is to her; the nicer he is to her, the less she nags him
about leaving wet towels on the bed, and ultimately,
they live happily ever after. In other words, men,
you might want to pick it up a notch in the domestic department. 05:31Here's an interesting one. One study found that people
who smile in childhood photographs are less likely to get a divorce. This is an actual study,
and let me clarify: the researchers were not looking
at documented self-reports of childhood happiness, or even studying old journals. The data were based entirely
on whether people looked happy in these early pictures. Now, I don't know how old all of you are,
but when I was a kid, your parents took pictures
with a special kind of camera that held something called ""film."" And, by God, film was expensive. They didn't take 300 shots of you
in that rapid-fire digital video mode and then pick out the nicest,
smiliest one for the Christmas card. Oh, no. They dressed you up, they lined you up, and you smiled for the fucking camera
like they told you to or you could kiss
your birthday party goodbye. But still, I have a huge pile
of fake happy childhood pictures and I'm glad they make me less likely
than some people to get a divorce. 06:38So, what else can you do
to safeguard your marriage? Do not win an Oscar for best actress. 06:45(Laughter) 06:47I'm serious. Bettie Davis, Joan Crawford,
Halle Berry, Hilary Swank, Sandra Bullock, Reese Witherspoon -- all of them single,
soon after taking home that statue. They actually call it the Oscar curse. It is the marriage kiss of death
and something that should be avoided. 07:04And it's not just successfully
starring in films that's dangerous. It turns out, merely watching
a romantic comedy causes relationship
satisfaction to plummet. 07:15(Laughter) 07:17Apparently, the bitter realization
that maybe it could happen to us, but it obviously hasn't
and it probably never will, makes our lives seem
unbearably grim in comparison. And theoretically, I suppose if we opt for a film
where someone gets brutally murdered or dies in a fiery car crash, we are more likely to walk out
of that theater feeling like we've got it pretty good. 07:41(Laughter) 07:43Drinking alcohol, it seems,
is bad for your marriage. Yeah. I can't tell you anymore about that one because I stopped reading it
at the headline. But here's a scary one:
divorce is contagious. That's right, when you have
a close couple friend split up, it increases your chances
of getting a divorce by 75 percent. Now, I have to say,
I don't get this one at all. My husband and I have watched
quite a few friends divide their assets and then struggle
with being our age and single in an age of sexting
and Viagra and eHarmony. And I'm thinking they've done
more for my marriage than a lifetime of therapy ever could. 08:29So now you may be wondering:
Why does anyone get married ever? Well, the US federal government
counts more than a thousand legal benefits to being someone's spouse. A list that includes
visitation rights in jail, but hopefully, you'll never need that one. But beyond the profound federal perks, married people make more money. We're healthier,
physically and emotionally. We produce happier, more stable
and more successful kids. We have more sex than our supposedly
swinging single friends, believe it or not. We even live longer, which is a pretty compelling argument
for marrying someone you like a lot in the first place. 09:17(Laughter) 09:18Now, if you're not currently experiencing
the joy of the joint tax return, I can't tell you how to find
a chore-loving person of the approximately ideal size
and attractiveness, who prefers horror movies and doesn't have a lot of friends
hovering on the brink of divorce, but I can only encourage you to try, because the benefits, as I've pointed out, are significant. The bottom line is: whether you're in it
or you're searching for it, I believe marriage is an institution
worth pursuing and protecting. So I hope you'll use the information
I've given you today to weigh your personal strengths
against your own risk factors. 09:56For instance, in my marriage,
I'd say I'm doing OK. One the one hand, I have a husband who's annoyingly lean
and incredibly handsome. So I'm obviously going
to need fatten him up. And like I said, we have
those divorced friends who may secretly or subconsciously
be trying to break us up. So we have to keep an eye on that. And we do like a cocktail or two. On the other hand, I have the fake happy picture thing. And also, my husband does
a lot around the house, and would happily never see
another romantic comedy as long as he lives. 10:35So I've got all those things going for me. But just in case, I plan to work extra hard
to not win an Oscar anytime soon. And for the good of your relationships, I would encourage you to do the same. I'll see you at the bar. 10:50(Laughter) 10:52(Applause)"

that nobody, absolutely nobody, is prepared to hear. I certainly wasn't. 00:08It was three years ago
that I got a call in my office with the test results of a recent scan. I was 35 and finally living
the life I wanted. I married my high school sweetheart and had finally gotten pregnant
after years of infertility. And then suddenly we had a Zach, a perfect one-year-old boy/dinosaur, depending on his mood. And having a Zach suited me perfectly. I had gotten the first job
I applied for in academia, land of a thousand crushed dreams. And there I was, working at my dream job with my little baby and the man I had imported from Canada. 00:54(Laughter) 00:55But a few months before,
I'd started feeling pain in my stomach and had gone to every expert
to find out why. No one could tell me. And then, out of the blue, some physician's assistant
called me at work to tell me that I had stage IV cancer, and that I was going to need
to come to the hospital right away. And all I could think of to say was, ""But I have a son. I can't end. This world can't end. It has just begun."" And then I called my husband,
and he rushed to find me and I said all the true things
that I have known. I said, ""I have loved you forever, I have loved you forever. I am so sorry. Please take care of our son."" And then as I began
the walk to the hospital, it crossed my mind for the first time, ""Oh. How ironic."" I had just written
a book called ""Blessed."" 01:57(Laughter) 02:00I am a historian and an expert in the idea
that good things happen to good people. I research a form of Christianity
nicknamed ""the prosperity gospel,"" for its very bold promise
that God wants you to prosper. I never considered myself
a follower of the prosperity gospel. I was simply an observer. The prosperity gospel believes
that God wants to reward you if you have the right kind of faith. If you're good and faithful, God will give you health and wealth and boundless happiness. Life is like a boomerang: if you're good, good things will always come back to you. Think positively. Speak positively. Nothing is impossible if you believe. 02:46I got interested in this
very American theology when I was 18 or so, and by 25 I was traveling the country
interviewing its celebrities. I spent a decade talking to televangelists with spiritual guarantees
for divine money. I interviewed countless megachurch pastors
with spectacular hair about how they live their best lives now. I visited with people
in hospital waiting rooms and plush offices. I held hands with people in wheelchairs, praying to be cured. I earned my reputation
as destroyer of family vacations for always insisting on being dropped off
at the fanciest megachurch in town. If there was a river
running through the sanctuary, an eagle flying freely in the auditorium, or an enormous spinning golden globe, I was there. 03:42When I first started studying this,
the whole idea of being ""blessed"" wasn't what it is today. It was not, like it is now, an entire line of ""#blessed"" home goods. It was not yet a flood of ""#blessed""
vanity license plates and T-shirts and neon wall art. I had no idea that ""blessed"" would become
one of the most common cultural cliches, one of the most used
hashtags on Instagram, to celebrate barely there bikini shots, as if to say, ""I am so blessed. Thank you, Jesus, for this body."" 04:16(Laughter) 04:20I had not yet fully grasped
the way that the prosperity gospel had become the great civil religion, offering another transcendent account of the core of the American Dream. Rather than worshipping
the founding of America itself, the prosperity gospel
worshipped Americans. It deifies and ritualizes their hungers, their hard work and moral fiber. 04:46Americans believe in a gospel of optimism, and they are their own proof. But despite telling myself, ""I'm just studying this stuff,
I'm nothing like them,"" when I got my diagnosis, I suddenly understood
how deeply invested I was in my own Horatio Alger theology. If you live in this culture,
whether you are religious or not, it is extremely difficult
to avoid falling into the trap of believing that virtue
and success go hand in hand. The more I stared down my diagnosis, the more I recognized
that I had my own quiet version of the idea that good things
happen to good people. Aren't I good? Aren't I special somehow? I have committed zero homicides to date. 05:37(Laughter) 05:39(Applause) 05:41So why is this happening to me? I wanted God to make me good and to reward my faith with just a few
shining awards along the way. OK, like, a lot of shining awards. 05:53(Laughter) 05:54I believed that hardships
were only detours on what I was certain would be
my long, long life. 06:02As is this case with many of us,
it's a mindset that served me well. The gospel of success drove me to achieve, to dream big, to abandon fear. It was a mindset that served me well until it didn't, until I was confronted with something
I couldn't manage my way out of; until I found myself
saying into the phone, ""But I have a son,"" because it was all
I could think of to say. 06:33That was the most difficult
moment to accept: the phone call, the walk to the hospital, when I realized that my own
personal prosperity gospel had failed me. Anything I thought was good
or special about me could not save me -- my hard work, my personality, my humor, my perspective. I had to face the fact that my life
is built with paper walls, and so is everyone else's. 07:04It is a hard thought to accept
that we are all a breath away from a problem that could
destroy something irreplaceable or alter our lives completely. We know that in life
there are befores and afters. I am asked all the time to say
that I would never go back, or that I've gained
so much in perspective. And I tell them no, before was better. 07:33A few months after I got sick,
I wrote about this and then I sent it off to an editor
at the ""New York Times."" In retrospect, taking one of the most
vulnerable moments of your life and turning into an op-ed is not an amazing way
to feel less vulnerable. 07:48(Laughter) 07:49I got thousands of letters and emails. I still get them every day. I think it is because
of the questions I asked. I asked: How do you live
without quite so many reasons for the bad things that happen? I asked: Would it be better to live
without outrageous formulas for why people deserve what they get? And what was so funny
and so terrible was, of course, I thought I asked people to simmer down on needing an explanation
for the bad things that happened. So what did thousands of readers do? Yeah, they wrote to defend the idea
that there had to be a reason for what happened to me. And they really want me
to understand the reason. People want me to reassure them
that my cancer is all part of a plan. A few letters even suggested
it was God's plan that I get cancer so I could help people
by writing about it. People are certain
it is a test of my character or proof of something terrible I've done. They want me to know without a doubt that there is a hidden logic
to this seeming chaos. They tell my husband, while I'm still in the hospital, that everything happens for a reason, and then stammer awkwardly when he says, ""I'd love to hear it. I'd love to hear the reason
my wife is dying."" 09:15And I get it. We all want reasons. We want formulas to predict whether
our hard work will pay off, whether our love and support
will always make our partners happy and our kids love us. We want to live in a world
in which not one ounce of our hard work or our pain
or our deepest hopes will be for nothing. We want to live in a world
in which nothing is lost. 09:46But what I have learned
in living with stage IV cancer is that there is no easy correlation between how hard I try and the length of my life. In the last three years,
I've experienced more pain and trauma than I ever thought I could survive. I realized the other day that I've had
so many abdominal surgeries that I'm on my fifth belly button, and this last one is my least favorite. 10:14(Laughter) 10:17footnotefootnoteBut at the same time,
I've experienced love, so much love, love I find hard to explain. The other day, I was reading the findings of the Near Death Experience
Research Foundation, and yes, there is such a thing. People were interviewed
about their brushes with death in all kinds of circumstances: car accidents, labor and delivery, suicides. And many reported the same odd thing: love. I'm sure I would have ignored it
if it hadn't reminded me of something I had experienced, something I felt
uncomfortable telling anyone: that when I was sure
that I was going to die, I didn't feel angry. I felt loved. It was one of the most surreal things
I have experienced. In a time in which I should have
felt abandoned by God, I was not reduced to ashes. I felt like I was floating, floating on the love and prayers of all those who hummed
around me like worker bees, bringing me notes and socks and flowers and quilts embroidered
with words of encouragement. But when they sat beside me, my hand in their hands, my own suffering began to feel
like it had revealed to me the suffering of others. I was entering a world
of people just like me, people stumbling around in the debris of dreams they thought
they were entitled to and plans they didn't
realize they had made. It was a feeling of being more connected,
somehow, with other people, experiencing the same situation. 11:57And that feeling
stayed with me for months. In fact, I'd grown so accustomed to it that I started to panic
at the prospect of losing it. So I began to ask friends, theologians,
historians, nuns I liked, ""What I am I going to do
when that loving feeling is gone?"" And they knew exactly
what I was talking about, because they had either
experienced it themselves or they'd read about it
in great works of Christian theology. And they said, ""Yeah, it'll go. The feelings will go. And there will be no formula
for how to get it back."" But they offered me
this little piece of reassurance, and I clung to it. They said, ""When the feelings recede like the tides, they will leave an imprint."" 12:45And they do. And it is not proof of anything, and it is nothing to boast about. It was just a gift. So I can't respond to
the thousands of emails I get with my own five-step plan
to divine health and magical floating feelings. I see that the world is jolted by events
that are wonderful and terrible, gorgeous and tragic. I can't reconcile the contradiction, except that I am beginning to believe
that these opposites do not cancel each other out. Life is so beautiful, and life is so hard. 13:30Today, I am doing quite well. The immunotherapy drugs
appear to be working, and we are watching
and waiting with scans. I hope I will live a long time. I hope I will live long enough
to embarrass my son and to watch my husband
lose his beautiful hair. And I think I might. But I am learning to live and to love without counting the cost, without reasons and assurances
that nothing will be lost. 14:05Life will break your heart, and life may take everything you have and everything you hope for. But there is one kind
of prosperity gospel that I believe in. I believe that in the darkness, even there, there will be beauty, and there will be love. And every now and then, it will feel like more than enough. 14:31Thank you. 14:33(Applause)"
1,The truth about faking orgasms,Karen Gurney,Oct 2022,"Whose pleasure is prioritized during sex, and why? Psychosexologist Karen Gurney explains how a lack of equal pleasure in the bedroom actually reflects broader gender inequality in society -- and asks you to reconsider what dynamics are at play, even behind closed doors.", (25K),"Transcript (6 Languages)EnglishEspañolFrançaisPortuguês de Portugalالعربية中文 (简体)00:00Take a moment to think
about your sex life. Don't worry, I'm a professional,
I ask this question all the time. My guess is that most of you
are thinking about solo pleasure or the interaction between you
and someone else, perhaps. There's probably very few of you who are thinking about how your sex life
connects to wider dynamics in society. 00:25Let me explain by starting
somewhere a little different. The gender pay gap has reduced
in the last three decades in the UK, and we have more women
in senior management positions than ever before. But there is also still
such a long way to go. Britain only ranks 21st
in the world for gender equality. And not all women benefit equally
from the advances we've made so far. Today, I'm going to tell you
how the orgasm gap, which is data about gender
inequality from sex science, is a lesser known but powerful indicator
of just how far we still have to go. 01:11Progress towards equality in any area is about breaking free
of entrenched social norms. And this is especially the case in sex. In my work, as a clinical psychologist specializing in helping people
with their sex lives, I noticed that we're often unaware
of how much of how we are sexually is dictated by forces outside of ourselves or outside of our sexual relationships. What we should say, how we're supposed to be, what we're supposed to look like, who does what and when, what we're supposed to be into. These scripts, they're all written for us, and we learn them from language,
from peers and from the media. 01:59I don't know about you, but I'm starting to see
a small change in these scripts. These days, my social media feeds are full of posts
about women's sexual empowerment and women's bodily autonomy
compared to, say, five years ago. And this is great. But in my work, I notice that this change
has not yet translated to real life and to the bedroom. Not that everyone has sex there,
but you know what I mean. 02:27(Laughter) 02:31I see plenty of women in my clinic who tell me that they feel
more empowered than ever to take up space, to call out misogyny, to demand a seat at the table. But when it comes to their sex lives, they can't seem to bring themselves
to feel empowered in the same way. They tell me that they feel
silenced, disempowered and made to feel
that they are the problem. And they don't know how to tackle it. 03:03So why is this happening? Well, we used to think
that women’s orgasms were hard to come by, and that because they were ""tricky,"" this was the obvious explanation as to why when cis men
and cis women have sex together, it's more often the man
who leaves feeling satisfied. This is a common myth. And it's kind of got in the way
of us really noticing and questioning this imbalance
of pleasure across genders. This ""tricky orgasm"" myth
has been challenged by various pieces of sex research
over the last few decades, and we now know
that when people masturbate, there is no difference
in the rates of orgasm or the time taken to orgasm
across genders, turning this idea of women's orgasms
being more complex or taking longer on its head. But this sex science, and the fact that only a minority of women
can come from vaginal penetration without any clitoral stimulation, is still not that widely known, leaving many women feeling
like they are the problem, that they're taking too long or needing something unusual to get there. When in fact, they're entirely normal. Feeling abnormal leads them to fake it, and faking it gives
their partner the wrong idea of what women's bodies need. Meaning the next woman who tries to assert what she wants
or needs with that partner is seen as difficult
or labeled as “hard work.” As a result, research tells us that men
consistently overestimate how often women orgasm
during partnered sex. And underestimate how often
women are faking it. This is the reason why some women
describe partnered sex as like ""listening to your favorite song, but having the radio switched off
before it gets to the best bit."" 05:12(Laughter) 05:16But why does it matter? Well, the first thing to say is that orgasms are not the be-all
and end-all of good sex and we must not treat them as if they are. Good sex can bring connection, stress relief, affirmation,
intimacy and fun. And orgasms are just
another reward like these, that serve to make us feel good and keep humans coming back for more. But what if the pleasure
of one group of people is consistently privileged
over the pleasure of another? What does that tell us about our society? 05:59I mentioned earlier
that people of all genders can orgasm at a similar rate
when they're alone. And that rate is
about 95 percent of the time. The orgasm gap refers
to data from sex science, which tells us how our
chances of orgasming can move from this 95 percent when we have sex with another person. The biggest gap we see
is for women having sex with men. When their chances of orgasming drop from this 95 percent
they might expect alone to around 65 percent
with a regular partner. We see an even bigger gap emerging
with casual or hookup sex between women and men, when women's chance of orgasming
drops further still. Crucially, men's rate of orgasming
when having sex with women stays at around 85 to 95 percent, whether that's a regular partner, casual sex and just as reliably
as when they're on their own. We don't see such a dramatic orgasm gap when LGBTQ+ people
have sex with each other. So, for example, women
having sex with women can expect an orgasm rate
only slightly less than when they're on their own. 07:16This data is important because it tells us that it's gender which is responsible for inequality
in the experience of orgasms. Not anatomy, not capacity for pleasure, but rather whose pleasure
is prioritized as most important. As a society, we still
aren't signed up to an idea that women's sexual pleasure
is as important as men's. We're happy to strive for it, but only if the route to achieving it
doesn't jeopardize men's pleasure in the process. 07:54Now there is a complex mix of factors
which maintains the orgasm gap. Firstly, not knowing what's normal. And feeling as if it's your
body which is wrong. Falling for this old idea that your
orgasms are somehow tricky, even though you know
that they're not when you're alone. Secondly, women being socialized
to put other people's needs first and being polite so as to not hurt
someone else's feelings or ego. And lastly, the simple fact that the patriarchy
shows itself in the way men and women have sex together. The sheer physicality of a sexual script which favors penis and vagina sex
above all else as ""real sex,"" simply suits men's anatomy more. This is one of the reasons we don't see
such a dramatic orgasm gap when women have sex with other women, and we can learn from this. Ditch the script and have more sex which looks like the sex you enjoy alone. 09:05So, what are we to do? Stop faking it. Yes, I know you've all done it. And you're so, so good at it. 09:16(Laughter) 09:17I know it comes from a place
of not feeling normal or wanting to communicate something or trying to protect
someone else's feelings. But all faking does
is strengthen this patriarchal script and means your needs
are less likely to be met over time. We can also notice how inequality
shows up in the bedroom. Is it OK with you that your needs
are sidelined in favor of someone else’s? How does that fit with your values around equality
and other areas of your life? It’s OK to be motivated by something
other than orgasms when you have sex. But this should be your choice to make, not some kind of sexual
glass ceiling based on gender. 10:06And lastly, by showing up for each other. If more women felt able
to be upfront about their pleasure and what their body needs, this would pave the way for women
collectively to benefit. It would mean the next woman who tries
to be open about what her body needs would be less likely to be dismissed
as complex or unusual. It would change the story. It would redress the balance. 10:39But this journey isn't just
for women to take. Men can show up here also, by believing women
when they say what they need. These women are not the outliers
you think they are. They are the voice of change. Men can also show up by understanding that women's capacity for pleasure
is equal to their own and by genuinely championing sex
which has mutual pleasure at its core, even if that means sacrificing their own, more comfortable position
of privilege from time to time. 11:15So, let's start a revolution. After all, who knows what the impact
of gender equality behind closed doors might have on the rest of society. 11:27Thank you. 11:28(Applause and cheers)"

that's me up there. (Laughter) Enjoying the spotlight
or commanding attention does not come naturally to me. Blending into the background,
analyzing and observing a situation, is where I find the most comfort, or, as I'll get to later on in this talk,
when I'm on the road by myself. Unless this lady is with me. Yes, I'm referring to my camera as a lady. (Laughter) She is my safety blanket, and I've spent more time with my camera
than with most people in my life. I'm an artist, I am a photographer, I'm a self-described nomadic creator. It's one of those creative professions
that when you tell people, they say, ""Wow, I wish I could do that!"" Or, ""What do you really do for work?"" (Laughter) Or my personal favorite,
""Did you go to school for this?"" (Laughter) And, as with most things that we don't
have personal experience with, we make our own assumptions and judgments based off of the only tangible things
that we can grab from. So, when you say ""photographer,"" people often think ""weddings,""
or ""high school portraits,"" or the ridiculous way photographers
are depicted in TV and movies. And I am going to show you
what I do and why I do it. Now, when people first meet me
or hear about me, this is what they're interested in. Now, I could stand here and I can talk about how I've brushed
shoulders with world leaders, and my surreal five minutes
that I spent with President Obama. Or I could talk about
photographing Hillary Clinton a week before the election,
after a rally in North Carolina. Or the tremendous emotional weight
for myself photographing Darren Wilson a year after the events in Ferguson,
Missouri, for the New Yorker, to then, only a year later,
photograph Bryan Stevenson, and he is an advocate and a lawyer
based out of Mobile, Alabama, who fights for the under-represented, and we had a conversation about race
that still stays with me today. Or just what's the easiest
and what most people can relate to: celebrity. So, I could talk about Agelina Jolie, or I could talk about the TV icon
that's Sarah Jessica Parker, or I can just talk about the numerous
actors and musicians and notable people that I've interacted with
over the last decade. And I love my job and I love my work, but that's not what I'm here
to talk to you about. I'm going to talk about
when I'm in my 2003 Buick, driving cross-country for weeks at a time, and how that's when I'm feeling
the most fulfilled. But first, I need to give
a little backstory on me and why I do what I do. So, think of it like in an abridged
episode of ""This American Life,"" just not that long. (Laughter) So, I am a white, cis, queer man from a working-class family in New York, and with all things being relative, I didn't grow up 
with the utmost privilege, and it wasn't uniquely terrible either. My parents, however,
were too involved with their own demons for me to ever truly feel seen or heard. And it wasn't necessarily their fault. It was merely just a casualty
of their reality. Depression, addiction, anger, resentment
overwhelmed both of them. When I was seven, my mother
was diagnosed with cancer. It was the first of a decade-long battle
that she ended up surviving from. It was also the same time that she
showed me how to make her a screwdriver. When I was ten, I knew that I was queer,
or that I at least liked boys, and by 13, my mother outed me. It was an experience that let me feeling
like my identity was stripped from me. By 14, my dad had a DUI or two,
I don't really remember. By 16, he moved out of the house, and by 18, I didn't really speak
to either of them. So, my world up until
this point made me feel that my experiences and my feelings would never actually compare
to that of my parents. And intellectually, I knew better, but I didn't actually know
what would make me feel differently. All I knew was that I didn't want
anyone that came into my life to ever feel like they were not seen. And then, I picked up a camera. For me, photography was always
really interesting because of the immediacy
and collaborative nature of it. It would be a way for me to meet people that were outside of the safe mental
bubble that I had created for myself. And so, I started photographing, and as I started interacting
with other people, I realized that the interaction itself
was actually more interesting to me than the photograph. When I started realizing that, and I thought about my dad,
who had recently got sober, I wanted him to feel seen. So, at this point,
he and I were still very estranged, and I was in graduate school and my professor, Collier Schorr,
said something to me that still echoes in my head
pretty much every day: my work was ""too easy,"" and just because I could make
something that ""looked good"" did not mean that it was interesting. And so, I needed to challenge
myself and my craft. Ironically enough, after years of spending
my time making myself feel comfortable, I needed to be uncomfortable again. So, I asked my dad if he would be willing
to sit for a portrait. This was the first one that I took of him. Then, I took a break because I needed
to do a lot of soul-searching to figure out what it was
that I actually wanted to do with him. And so, I continued to photograph him and we started to have a dialogue,
but it was through photographs. And I even actually started
taking portraits of myself with him because I wanted to, at first, just have
a close physical proximity to him. And the idea of this made me realize
I needed full immersion, I needed no easy escape plan. And so, I asked him, kind of not even
thinking it would happen, if he would go on the road trip
that we never took when I was a kid, and surprisingly, he said,
""Yeah, sure, let's do it."" And so, he and I hit the road, and as this happened, we started creating this fantasy
relationship that never actually existed. (Laughter) But the experience
of making these photographs created a bond between the two of us
that we were incapable of doing otherwise. It was my a-ha moment for photography. I was using my camera as a therapist. It became this third party that allowed the two of us
to communicate with each other even when we weren't actually talking. We finally actually saw each other. So, fast-forward about a decade later, and I am no longer working with my dad, but I am photographing strangers
spontaneously that I meet on the road. Now, about a month before the election,
I was having tremendous anxiety and feeling very stagnant
about my work in general. I began seeing friends withdraw and the overall feeling
of frustration on social media. And to be quite honest,
I just wanted to escape. And so, I hit the road, and I didn't have 
any destinations in mind. I just knew I wanted 
to drive cross-country and I wanted to escape. And then, about a day
into being on the road, I realized I needed to be doing something
while I was on the road, because being just with yourself can lead
to a lot, a lot of soul-searching. So, once I realized I wanted
to be doing something, I thought back to the time with my dad and how pivotal
and also very cathartic it was for me, for my craft
and also my mental health. And so, I wanted to do that 
with strangers, and I went on Instagram,
I went on Facebook, I downloaded all of the dating
and hook-up apps, and I started messaging
everyone that I could within every town that I stopped in. Now, when a stranger 
approaches you online, it leads to a little hesitation. And I say ""stranger""
and I just want to let you know I'm utilizing a community
that is already comfortable for me, and that's of gay 
or queer-identifying men. And so, I would send messages with a brief little description
of what I was doing. I wanted to come and meet you,
I wanted to come to your home, we could meet in public,
and I wanted to take your portrait - I got the majority of [them] being noes, and a lot of variations
of, ""That's creepy"" or - (Laughter) ""I don't really photograph well."" But there was something
that did come up pretty often, and it was, ""Why me?"" And it was that other a-ha moment for me. There didn't need to be a ""why me."" I wanted everyone that I interacted with
to not only feel special, but to also feel like their
stories could be heard. So, this body of work, it's called
""The Day of The Lone Wolf,"" and it's from a book called
""The Secret [Language] of Birthdays,"" and it happens to be
the day that I was born on. Now, I casually mentioned
my mother earlier, and it was by no accident. Her and I are still estranged, but I wanted to take
this moment to thank her. When I was younger, she read to me
from The Secret Language of Birthdays, and she used the personality traits that were depicted
for The Day of The Lone Wolf, both to criticize and also
occasionally appraise me, such as emotionally ""sensitive,""
and ""impulsive,"" and ""contradictory."" Now in my mid 30's I've reclaimed my identity as a queer man and I've also reclaimed
The Day of The Lone Wolf, and I'm creating in honor of it. So, since that first road trip, I've gotten cross-country two more times, and the only thing that you actually know
about these photographs is the common denominator is me. Now, everyone has a story,
you've been listening to mine - And so, while you may not know
the particulars of their struggles or of their achievements
or even of their privilege, there is one thing that you do know: they allowed themselves
to be vulnerable with a stranger, and that's what I've done with you today. Thank you. (Applause)"
1,How to speed up chemical reactions (and get a date),Aaron Sams,Jun 2012,"The complex systems of high school dating and chemical reactions may have more in common than you think. Explore five rules for speeding up chemical reactions in the lab that might just land you a date to a dance! [Directed by Andrew Park, narrated by Aaron Sams].", (55K),"Transcript (21 Languages)Bahasa IndonesiaEnglishEspañolFrançaisHrvatskiItalianoPolskiPortuguês brasileiroPortuguês de PortugalRomânăTiếng ViệtTürkçeΕλληνικάРусскийУкраїнськаעבריתالعربية中文 (简体)中文 (繁體)日本語한국어00:14Meet our chemist, Harriet. She has a chemical reaction
that needs to occur more quickly. A chemist has some processes
at her disposal that can help her speed up her reaction, and she knows of five ways. And to remember them, she thinks back to her days
as a high school student, and the day she got a date for the dance. Harriet was in high school,
studying between classes. She had lost track of time
and was going to be late to class. Unbeknownst to her, Harold, who was just around the corner,
was running late, too. They both sprinted to class and, as it happened, sprinted
directly into one another. Now, this was no small collision. They ran squarely
into one another in such a way that he knocked the books
right out of her hand. ""I'm sorry,"" he said. ""Let me
help you with your books."" He kindly helped her
re-collect her belongings, and politely offered to walk her to class. And you'll never guess who went
together to the dance later that year. Yup, those two. So as we can see from this example, the key to getting a date for the dance
is to collide with someone and knock the books out of their hands. Now, you're probably already aware that not all collisions lead
to dates for the dance, thankfully. The collisions must have
two important characteristics: One, correct orientation that allows
books to be knocked from one's hands; and two, enough energy
to knock the books out. Shortly after this incident, Harriet decided to tell me,
her chemistry teacher, all about it. I noticed some interesting parallels between her story
and chemical reaction rates, which happened to be
what she was studying in the hallway the day of the collision. Together, we decided
to set out on two missions. Harriet wanted to help all
chemistry students and chemists remember how to speed up
the rate of chemical reactions and I, being the nice guy that I am, decided to make it my mission
to help create educational environments in which more book-dropping
collisions can take place to increase future chemists' chances
of getting a date for the dance. In order to facilitate this improved
dance-date-getting process, I propose five changes to all schools that parallel Harriet's five ways
to increase chemical reaction rates. First, I propose that we shrink
the size of the hallways. This will make it more difficult
to safely navigate the hallways and will cause more collisions
than in larger hallways. And by increasing
the number of collisions, we increase the likelihood that some of those collisions
will have the correct alignment and enough energy
to create a date to the dance. Now, chemically speaking, this is equivalent to lowering
the volume of a reaction vessel or a reaction mixture. In doing so, the individual
particles are closer together, and more collisions will occur. More collisions means a greater likelihood that collisions with the appropriate
energy and configuration will happen. Second, I propose increasing
the overall population of the school. More students equals more collisions. By increasing the number of particles
available for collision, we create an environment
where more collisions can take place. Third, we must reduce the time
allowed between classes -- heck, let's just cut it in half. In doing so, students
will need to move more quickly to get from one class to the next. This increase in velocity
will help make sure collisions have the appropriate
amount of energy necessary to ensure book-dropping. This is analogous to increasing
the temperature of the reaction mixture. Higher temperature
means particles are moving faster. Faster-moving particles means more energy, and a greater likelihood
of the reaction-causing collision. Fourth, students must stop
traveling in packs. By traveling in packs,
the students on the outside of the pack insulate those in the middle
from undergoing any collisions. By splitting up, each student
has more area exposed that is available for a collision
from a passing student. When particles travel in packs,
the surface area is very small, and only the outside
particles can collide. However, by breaking up the clumps
into individual particles, the total surface area is increased, and each particle has
an exposed surface that can react. Fifth and finally, we hire a matchmaker. Is this colliding
and book-dropping too violent? Is there an easier way to get a date
that requires less initial energy? Then a matchmaker will help with this. The matchmaker makes it easier
for a couple to get together, by coordinating the match. Our matchmaker is like a catalyst. Chemical catalysts function
by lowering the activation energy -- in other words, by lowering the energy
required to start a reaction. They do this by bringing
two particles together and orienting them correctly
in space so that the two can meet at the correct configuration
and allow a reaction to take place. So, to sum up: if a future chemist
wants a date for the dance, he must collide with another person and knock the books out of their hands. And if a chemist wants to make
a chemical reaction occur, the particles must collide
in the correct orientation with an appropriate amount of energy. And both of these processes
can be accelerated, using the five methods I've described."

In Spanish with subtitles.", (19K),"Transcript (4 Languages)EnglishEspañolPortuguês de PortugalРусскийElia Gasparolo, TranslatorSebastian Betti, Reviewer00:14In fact, I'm a science disseminator 
out of curiosity, that extreme curiosity in understanding the way nature works, our body, the universe, the brain, these 87 billion of interconnected neurons that encode this strange behavior we have, that we don't know 
if we should follow reason or feelings. Science, actually, gives us 
a different perspective of the reality and opens up our minds and amazes us even 
in the most ordinary events. In fact, one of the most 
revolutionary days in my career as a science disseminator was at a neuroscience congress where, walking by the posters section, I read the following work: ""Clitoral stimulation induces 
Fos activation in the rat brain."" Sure, you keep staring at the poster and get closer to the researcher and say: ""Do you stimulate the rats' clitoris?"" (Laughter) ""Yes, I do."" ""And how do you do it?"" ""With a brush; I do three 
or four repetitions and stop. Three or four repetitions and stop. Because that is the way rats copulate."" I kept thinking and she noticed
I was somewhat skeptical. And I said: ""Hey, it is very important
that we investigate the sexual function. We, scientists, investigate the 
complete functioning of the body, why aren't we going to research
on sexuality?"" I thought for a while, and it's true: after so much time working
as a communicator, Why haven't I written about sexuality? Out of taboo? The same taboo society has about sex, is shared by medicine and science. But she said something very curious: ""I study the hormones that encode desire. And I'm convinced about it
because neurophysiologically, we are not that different from rats -- and it's true; psychologically, yes; 
but neurophysiologically, no -- I'm convinced that behind that there could also be an explanation for some male and female issues
related to desire. There are many sexual problems."" ""More than you think,"" she told me. And I was wondering, is it true? I searched for scientific material, and, indeed, I found in ""The Lancet,"" one of the greatest science magazines, data that show that approximately 40 percent of men and more 
than 50 percent of women, even excepting old age, at a certain moment will have a problem related to sexuality. Clearly, it was something
I had to investigate about. And where to start? To see the researcher then and learn about all this hormone issue; testosterone and desire increase, dopamine and pleasure stimulation, prolactin and pleasure decrease, oxytocin segregated after orgasm is the love hormone keeping us together, but also, let's see something --
I teach you right now because, surely, 
you have never seen it before -- (Laughter) clitorial stimulation of rats. It's curious, because a lot of people say: ""I had no idea rats had clitoris."" And some women say: ""Well, there are some men
that seem to ignore women have it too!! (Laughter) But many of us don't know -- I didn't know it, at least
when I started this research -- is that clitoris is much bigger
than we think. It is internal, in most of the cases; on the exterior, the glans
is like the tip of the iceberg Actually, these images you see in grey,
with a triangular shape, is the internal part of the clitoris,
it is like a penis, that grows inside, has an erection and it is so big that gets closer 
to the front wall of the vagina and sometimes, you've heard about G spot... the G spot none of you know about; you know it's a spot that
generates more sexual arousal, but you don't know why. It is because the clitoris gets 
so close to the vagina that when you touch
2 to 3 centimeters upwards, you get in contact with its internal part, and, at that moment, pleasure increases. But truly, what is an orgasm? Orgasm, physiologically, is the activation of the sympathetic
nervous system. That is, to experience
sexual arousal, to be normal, we have a parasympathetic nervous system which keeps us relaxed. But during sexual arousal
there is a moment of explosion when the pupils dilate, the blood flows to the muscles, a series of secretions 
are released in the body that activate this orgasmic response. A piece of advice: for example,
now you know this, if you are having sexual intercourse
and someone groans with pleasure, but pupils are not dilated, 
there is no tachycardia, or no blushing of the upper part of 
the chest or chins, that person may be faking it. It's really important to know that, because these sympathetic nerves 
regulate the coming of the orgasm. For example, when someone is nervous
and has the fibers excited, has premature ejaculation. Or when wine relaxes us, if we drink a lot of wine that slows down
the sympathetic nervous system, women, particularly, take longer to reach orgasm. Or dominance and submission that generate tension in the body
and facilitate orgasm. Or the tantra, that wonderful species 
of sexual behavior that allows the body to feel 
relaxed and excited at the same time and entirely sensitive. I had to move a step forward, because
eventually, when we talk about orgasm, people say: ""Yes, they are clitoral 
or vaginal orgasms."" Actually, they are all brain orgasms. The order to begin orgasm comes 
from the brain. I interviewed Barry Komisaruk. Barry Komisaruk is a researcher
of the Rutgers University who asked women to stimulate different
areas of their genitals to see which areas of their brains 
were activated in order to study the sexual response. It was really interesting, because 
he even saw different types of orgasms. If you haven't felt 
different kind of orgasms it means you haven't experienced enough. Because they are real, different nerves
send the information from the internal part of the vagina, 
from the external part, so it is worth the exploration. But Barry told me something. He said: ""I'm going to start
a research with men. Would you like to be a volunteer?"" And my first answer was: ""No."" And I realized this social restrain
we have regarding sex. I had taken part in a lot of studies; why did I repressed myself from
participation on a study on sexuality? So then I rebelled, and became the first man in the world having an orgasm under a functional
magnetic resonance imaging scan (Laughter) (Applause) And this is my brain from the beginning of the stimulation 
to the end, and it was interesting as it perceived the areas that started; the limbic system, the hypothalamus,
the cortex. Well, in fact, a part of the brain cortex related to control, is the only one off during orgasm. All the rest of the brain was... is the activity that activates most areas
of the brain at the same time; except for this cortex. And it was fantastic, 20 seconds later,
the brain was completely off. And it is very similar to
what happened with women. Actually, the scans were the same; 
men and women. Men and women are more alike than we believe. There is much more diversity 
within the men group and within the women group, than in the opposite sex cases. But this takes place when we move forward
and take the psychological part and here comes the complexity,
because sexuality, indeed, has an endocrine, physiological,
neuroscientific, psychological and cultural side. And now, one of the most peculiar cases is the attraction. Why are we attracted to a certain person 
and not to another? Surely there is a biological aspect. It's said the symmetry is a beauty trait. Surely, there's a cultural part: 
in a culture, we like ones and others. But through experiments you realize that even, the emotional part
plays a relevant role. When we are sad,
we don't like the same people than when we are happy. When you go to a party and feel 
the most attractive woman there, you'll check out certain kind of guys. If you are not that self confident,
and see other women you consider prettier, you will check out other guys. Even hunger affects your choices. And this is a very funny experiment. Half of the students were asked
to come to the experiment satisfied, after having eaten a lot. They had no idea. And other students came hungry, 
with a 10 hours fast. They were shown these images
of the same girl, but they distorted her shape
from a slimmer to a more plump body. And you know what? They were asked which they liked best. and the hungry group liked 
more plump figures. Our inner emotional state conditions our likes in each moment. Talking about attraction, 
there is a very important issue. If I tell you, we should respect 
any sexual diversity it's rather obvious. A lot more people say so. But, I had a question from 
a scientific point of view which is valid from that approach. Can the sexual orientation be changed? It's absurd, we know that, to ask people
to try to change their nature, but, is it possible? And I ran into this scientific study
from 1968 where it was intended,
through electroshocks, and aversive chemical therapy, when they were watching homosexual images, to change gays' sexual orientation. And I interviewed, since he's still alive,
the author, John Bancroft, once the director of Kings Institute. You know what he said?
It was quite revealing. He said, ""We, at that time -- 
now we know it's atrocious -- but we thought we were doing them a favor, because at that time, homosexuality
was not approved and they suffered a lot and we thought we could change them. You know what? Despite their intentions,
and electroshocks, aversive therapy, they didn't change. And the ones who tried it,
bore a great suffering for not changing. So, the conclusion is pretty obvious: the ones to be cured are not homosexuals. The ones are homophobes. (Applause) We... (Applause) Thank you. (Applause) It is essential to accept diversity and we have to be the first ones 
to accept it. For instance, each person lives sexuality
as desired. Kiko is a boy who uses a wheelchair. And has no sensitivity in his genitals. I'm treated as if I were asexual;
as if I had no desire, and of course I have it, 
of course I get aroused, and of course I have 
a different sexuality."" Actually, Kiko is a very sexual person,
who has his partners. Opposite to Rebeca; she is asexual and has no desire. She has never felt desire;
not even as a teenager, and she doesn't feel attracted to anybody
either, neither boys nor girls. This is called an asexual person. And Rebeca told me: ""And you know what?
I'm really happy."" But the key is not about having
more or less sex, it's about having the sex quantity
and quality you want. That's the important thing. Then, we get into this
scientific-sexual adventure into something even more complicated. The couple; it's not about one but two. And here there is a constant interplay
between nature and culture. Because if we look at our nature,
we do have a monogamy tendency, since we are primates -- actually, in this aspect, we are 
more similar to birds than to cats -- because our offspring needs
both progenitors to survive. That's why nature has codified monogamy; that is, the tendency to fall in love 
and have a couple. Monogamy is natural. But not fidelity. There is no animal species that is 
faithful to a partner, even birds, that are such a romantic couple. If they get lost, when going for food and find better genes, they definitely
take the most of it. So, here we have the culture pressure in our relationships with a partner. And it's ok, we have to obey culture
not biology. But, there are people who start looking for other couple models, they look for broadening this behavior to polyamory or swinging in order to adapt them to their needs. I, after all this adventure, realized that there are five steps to have 
a complete sexual life. The first one, to eliminate traumas. Possibly, most of you have no traumas, but the ones who unconsciously have them and are a little haunted 
and not fully aware of them, should have a psychological cleanse. Be at ease with yourselves. Then, health. People always ask me:
""Is sex good for health?"" I say: ""Yes, but health 
has to be good for sex."" That is, the cardiovascular 
and the nervous system, they have to be in very good condition
to have satisfying sexual intercourses. Then, after knowing yourself;
self awareness seems a cliché but I mean knowing how our body works and also our couple; men have the feeling that they
already know a lot of themselves, and... No, no, no. We have to know ourselves better. With these three things: psychological
cleanse, health and self-awareness, we have a satisfactory sex life. Now, if we want to have
a great sex life, it's the turn to open our minds,
read, explore, and, finally, experiment. I wish you a joyful sex life and, above all, enjoy science 
and knowledge as well. Thank you very much. (Applause)"
1,Are we designed to be sexual omnivores?,Christopher Ryan,Feb 2014,"An idea permeates our modern view of relationships: that men and women have always paired off in sexually exclusive relationships. But before the dawn of agriculture, humans may actually have been quite promiscuous. Author Christopher Ryan walks us through the controversial evidence that human beings are sexual omnivores by nature, in hopes that a more nuanced understanding may put an end to discrimination, shame and the kind of unrealistic expectations that kill relationships.", (70K),"Transcript (27 Languages)DeutschEnglishEspañolFrançaisHrvatskiItalianoMagyarPolskiPortuguês brasileiroPortuguês de PortugalRomânăTiếng ViệtTürkçeČeštinaΕλληνικάРусскийСрпски, SrpskiУкраїнськабългарскимакедонскиעבריתالعربيةفارسى中文 (简体)中文 (繁體)日本語한국어00:00I'm going to go off script and make Chris quite nervous here by making this audience participation. All right. Are you with me? Yeah. Yeah. All right. 00:09So what I'd like to do is have you raise your hand if you've ever heard a
heterosexual couple having sex. Could be the neighbors, hotel room, your parents. Sorry. Okay. Pretty much everybody. Now raise your hand if the man was making more noise than the woman. I see one guy there. It doesn't count if it was you, sir. (Laughter) So his hand's down. And one woman. Okay. Sitting next to a loud guy. 00:38Now what does this tell us? It tells us that human beings make noise when they have sex, and it's generally the woman who makes more noise. This is known as female copulatory vocalization to the clipboard crowd. I wasn't even going to mention this, but somebody told me that Meg Ryan might be here, and she is the world's most famous female copulatory vocalizer. So I thought, got to talk about that. We'll get back to that a little bit later. 01:04Let me start by saying human beings are not descended from apes, despite what you may have heard. We are apes. We are more closely related
to the chimp and the bonobo than the African elephant is to the Indian elephant, as Jared Diamond pointed
out in one of his early books. We're more closely related to chimps and bonobos than chimps and bonobos are related to any other primate -- gorillas, orangutans, what have you. So we're extremely closely related to them, and as you'll see in terms of our behavior, we've got some relationship as well. So what I'm asking today, the question I want to explore with you today is, what kind of ape are we in terms of our sexuality? Now, since Darwin's day there's been what Cacilda and I have called the standard narrative of human sexual evolution, and you're all familiar with it, even if you haven't read this stuff. The idea is that, as part of human nature, from the beginning of our species' time, men have sort of leased
women's reproductive potential by providing them with certain goods and services. Generally we're talking about meat, shelter, status, protection, things like that. And in exchange, women have offered fidelity, or at least a promise of fidelity. Now this sets men and women up
in an oppositional relationship. The war between the sexes is built right into
our DNA, according to this vision. Right? What Cacilda and I have argued is that no, this economic relationship, this oppositional relationship, is actually an artifact of agriculture, which only arose about 10,000
years ago at the earliest. Anatomically modern human beings have been around for about 200,000 years, so we're talking about five percent, at most, of our time as a modern, distinct species. So before agriculture, before the agricultural revolution, it's important to understand that human beings lived in hunter-gatherer groups that are characterized wherever they're found in the world by what anthropologists called fierce egalitarianism. They not only share things, they demand that things be shared: meat, shelter, protection, all these things that were supposedly being traded to women for their sexual fidelity, it turns out, are shared widely among these societies. Now I'm not saying that our ancestors were noble savages, and I'm not saying modern day hunter-gatherers
are noble savages either. What I'm saying is that this is simply the best way to mitigate risk in a foraging context. And there's really no argument
about this among anthropologists. All Cacilda and I have done is extend
this sharing behavior to sexuality. So we've argued that human sexuality has essentially evolved, until agriculture, as a way of establishing and maintaining the complex, flexible social systems, networks, that our ancestors were very good at, and that's why our species has survived so well. 04:14Now, this makes some people uncomfortable, and so I always need to take 
a moment in these talks to say, listen, I'm saying our ancestors were promiscuous, but I'm not saying they were
having sex with strangers. There were no strangers. Right? In a hunter-gatherer band, there are no strangers. You've known these people your entire life. So I'm saying, yes, there were
overlapping sexual relationships, that our ancestors probably had
several different sexual relationships going on at any given moment in their adult lives. But I'm not saying they were
having sex with strangers. I'm not saying that they didn't love the
people they were having sex with. And I'm not saying there was
no pair-bonding going on. I'm just saying it wasn't sexually exclusive. 04:54And those of us who have
chosen to be monogamous -- my parents, for example, have been married for 52 years monogamously, and if it wasn't monogamously, Mom and Dad, I don't want to hear about it— I'm not criticizing this and I'm not saying there's anything wrong with this. What I'm saying is that to argue that our ancestors were sexual omnivores is no more a criticism of monogamy than to argue that our ancestors
were dietary omnivores is a criticism of vegetarianism. You can choose to be a vegetarian, but don't think that just because
you've made that decision, bacon suddenly stops smelling good. Okay? So this is my point. (Laughter) That one took a minute to sink in, huh? 05:43Now, in addition to being a great genius, a wonderful man, a wonderful husband, a wonderful father, Charles Darwin was also a world-class Victorian prude. All right? He was perplexed by the sexual swellings of certain primates, including chimps and bonobos, because these sexual swellings tend to provoke many males to mate with the females. So he couldn't understand why on Earth would
the female have developed this thing if all they were supposed to be doing
is forming their pair bond, right? Chimps and bonobos, Darwin didn't really know this, but chimps and bonobos mate one to four times per hour with up to a dozen males per day when they have their sexual swellings. Interestingly, chimps have sexual swellings through 40 percent, roughly, of their menstrual cycle, bonobos 90 percent, and humans are among the
only species on the planet where the female is available for sex throughout the menstrual cycle, whether she's menstruating,
whether she's post-menopausal, whether she's already pregnant. This is vanishingly rare among mammals. So it's a very interesting aspect of human sexuality. Now, Darwin ignored the reflections of the sexual swelling in his own day, as scientists tend to do sometimes. 07:02So what we're talking about is sperm competition. Now the average human ejaculate
has about 300 million sperm cells, so it's already a competitive environment. The question is whether these sperm are 
competing against other men's sperm or just their own. There's a lot to talk about in this chart. The one thing I'll call your attention to right away is the little musical note above the
female chimp and bonobo and human. That indicates female copulatory vocalization. Just look at the numbers. The average human has sex about 1,000 times per birth. If that number seems high for some of you, I assure you it seems low for others in the room. We share that ratio with chimps and bonobos. We don't share it with the other three apes, the gorilla, the orangutan and the gibbon, who are more typical of mammals, having sex only about a dozen times per birth. Humans and bonobos are the only 
animals that have sex face-to-face when both of them are alive. (Laughter) And you'll see that the human, chimp and bonobo all have external testicles, which in our book we equate to a special fridge you have in the garage just for beer. If you're the kind of guy who has a beer fridge in the garage, you expect a party to happen at any moment, and you need to be ready. That's what the external testicles are. They keep the sperm cells cool so you can have frequent ejaculations. I'm sorry. It's true. The human, some of you will be happy to hear, has the largest, thickest penis of any primate. 08:38Now, this evidence goes way beyond anatomy. It goes into anthropology as well. Historical records are full of accounts of people around the world who have sexual practices that should be impossible given what we have assumed
about human sexual evolution. These women are the Mosuo
from southwestern China. In their society, everyone, men and women, are completely sexually autonomous. There's no shame associated with sexual behavior. Women have hundreds of partners. It doesn't matter. Nobody cares.
Nobody gossips. It's not an issue. When the woman becomes pregnant, the child is cared for by her, 
her sisters, and her brothers. The biological father is a nonissue. On the other side of the planet, in the Amazon, we've got many tribes which practice what anthropologists call partible paternity. These people actually believe -- and they have no contact among them, no common language or anything, so it's not an idea that spread, it's an idea that's arisen around the world -- they believe that a fetus is literally made of accumulated semen. So a woman who wants to have a child who's smart and funny and strong makes sure she has lots of sex with the smart guy, the funny guy and the strong guy, to get the essence of each of
these men into the baby, and then when the child is born, these different men will come forward and acknowledge their paternity of the child. So paternity is actually sort of a team endeavor in this society. So there are all sorts of examples like this that we go through in the book. 10:05Now, why does this matter? Edward Wilson says we need to understand that human sexuality is first a bonding device and only secondarily procreation. I think that's true. This matters because our evolved sexuality is in direct conflict with many aspects of the modern world. The contradictions between what we're told we should feel and what we actually do feel generates a huge amount of unnecessary suffering. My hope is that a more accurate, updated understanding of human sexuality will lead us to have greater tolerance for ourselves, for each other, greater respect for unconventional
relationship configurations like same-sex marriage or polyamorous unions, and that we'll finally put to rest the idea that men have some innate, instinctive right to monitor and control women's sexual behavior. (Applause) Thank you. And we'll see that it's not only gay people that have to come out of the closet. We all have closets we have to come out of. Right? And when we do come out of those closets, we'll recognize that our fight is not with each other, our fight is with an outdated, 
Victorian sense of human sexuality that conflates desire with property rights, generates shame and confusion in place of understanding and empathy. It's time we moved beyond Mars and Venus, because the truth is that men are from Africa and women are from Africa. 11:43Thank you. 11:45(Applause) 11:54Chris Anderson: Thank you.
Christopher Ryan: Thank you. 11:57CA: So a question. It's so perplexing, trying to use arguments about evolutionary history to turn that into what we ought to do today. Someone could give a talk and say, look at us, we've got these really sharp teeth and muscles and a brain that's really good at throwing weapons, and if you look at lots of societies around the world, you'll see very high rates of violence. Nonviolence is a choice like vegetarianism, but it's not who you are. How is that different from the talk you gave? 12:32CR: Well first of all, the evidence for high levels of violence in prehistory is very debatable. But that's just an example. Certainly, you know, lots of people say to me, just because we lived a certain way in the past doesn't mean we should live that 
way now, and I agree with that. Everyone has to respond to the modern world. But the body does have its inherent evolved trajectories. And so you could live on
McDonald's and milkshakes, but your body will rebel against 
that. We have appetites. I think it was Schopenhauer who said, a person can do what they want but not want what they want. And so what I'm arguing against is the shame that's associated with desires. It's the idea that if you love your husband or wife but you still are attracted to other people, there's something wrong with you, there's something wrong with your marriage, something wrong with your partner. I think a lot of families are fractured by unrealistic expectations that are based upon this false
vision of human sexuality. That's what I'm trying to get at. 13:39CA: Thank you. Communicated
powerfully. Thanks a lot. 13:41CR: Thank you, Chris.

that you wrote a handwritten note? It's probably been a while. 00:04[The Way We Work] 00:08Technology has changed
the way we communicate. We send emails, not letters, text messages, not phone calls. We order delivery instead of
cooking dinners in our kitchen. All in the name of efficiency. But here's the point. Technology has made it
easier to communicate. But it hasn't made it easier to connect with other human beings. 00:25I've found that the secret to connecting in the high-tech, fast-paced
world that we live in, is doing a few small things
the old-fashioned way. 00:34Write a letter. I've written thousands
of handwritten notes. Thanking people for advice,
thanking them for an interview. It just puts that extra effort
to show someone that you really care and that you're willing
to go above and beyond. Some advice for writing a thank-you letter
is to really make it clear to the person that you're writing to the impact that they
have had on your life. Talk about something specific. Like ""Thank you
for the advice that you gave me. It's because of the advice you gave me,
that I am now doing x."" People are looking to make a difference. And so if you can show someone
that they've really had an impact on the life that you're living,
the life you're pursuing, it could have a huge impact. 01:10Pick up the phone and dial. We've hired thousands of employees. And I've personally called
every single one of them to welcome them to the Compass family. I'm able to set the tone
of really what I want the company to be. Where, you know,
people go above and beyond to make people feel welcomed
and to give people a sense of belonging. And sometimes I call people
on their last day of work. When people leave,
sometimes they're more transparent than they ever were when they
were still at the company. And so it's a great opportunity
to get feedback that is very hard to get otherwise. 01:39Ask interesting and meaningful questions
when you get outside of the office. When I'm traveling the country, every night I'll have dinner
with people in the company. And I like to ask questions like
""What's your underlying motivation? What's something that's happened
this week that meant a lot to you?"" And when you go around the table, and people really open up
and are able to engage, it sets a different tone. When people come back to the office, they can see each other
and they know each other in a deeper way. 02:04Answer questions with honesty. You know how it feels
when you go into an elevator and someone says, ""How was your weekend?"" It could've been the best weekend ever,
you could've met the love of your life, and you would say, ""Good, how was yours?"" If you want to connect with people,
then you have to open up. I'm not always that good at it,
and I imagine most people aren't. But that's why being open
stands out so much, because most people aren't. 02:26Turn the video on. I would always recommend
a videoconference over a phone call. Because that's when you can see
the real personality come out. When you're on video,
you're forced to be present. It's almost a forcing mechanism
to be in the moment. 02:38Nobody succeeds alone. The more you can take time to develop genuine,
authentic relationships, the more you're going to be able

1,7 common questions about workplace romance,Amy Nicole Baker,Dec 2018,Should you date your coworker? Should workplace couples keep their relationships secret? And why are coworkers so often attracted to each other? Organizational psychologist Amy Nicole Baker shares the real answers to commonly asked questions about romance at the office., (76K),"Transcript (26 Languages)Bahasa IndonesiaEnglishEspañolFrançaisItalianoMagyarNederlandsPolskiPortuguês brasileiroPortuguês de PortugalRomânăTiếng ViệtTürkçeΕλληνικάРусскийСрпски, Srpskiالعربيةفارسىکوردی سۆرانیکورمانجیภาษาไทยမြန်မာဘာသာ中文 (简体)中文 (繁體)日本語한국어Leslie Gauthier, TranslatorKrystian Aparta, Reviewer00:00Workplace romance can be a tricky topic. 00:02(Music) 00:03[The Way We Work] 00:05How do we manage the boundaries between our personal
and professional lives? How do we deal with gender imbalances
and power dynamics in the workplace? There's a lot of gray area
in workplace romance. I'd like to take a few minutes and answer some of your
frequently asked questions. 00:18So, question one:
Should I date my coworker? Uh ... it depends. Do you want to date
your coworker for a bit of fun? Do you want to date
your coworker to hook up? Because then you're really
better off on Tinder. If you want to date your coworker because you really, sincerely think
you're falling in love with them or there's a real potential
for a long-term, committed relationship, maybe you should date your coworker. Studies show that your coworkers
are generally positive about it if they perceive
that you're falling in love and genuinely care about each other. It's when your coworkers sense
that something else is in play -- that can be disruptive. 00:53Question two: Should I date my boss? In almost all cases, no,
you should not date your boss, because now, you've got a power dynamic. When there's a relationship
between a boss and a subordinate, it generates a lot of negative feelings, and the negative feelings
tend to fall on the person who's lower on the totem pole. People usually assume
some kind of favoritism, some kind of inside knowledge, and there can be resentment
stirred up by that. There was a study published last year that suggested dating a superior can even
have a negative impact on your career. The researchers asked
third-party evaluators online to imagine that they worked at a law firm. They asked them to make recommendations
on which employee should get picked for a special training program and which should get promoted to partner. They looked at credentials
for imaginary employees, and when it was stated
that an employee had been dating or was in a relationship with a superior, the evaluators were less likely to pick
that person for the training program or the promotion, even if they had the exact
same credentials as someone who wasn't dating their boss. The evaluators were also quick
to dismiss their accomplishments. 02:00Question three: Can I date someone who reports to me? Still a big no. You may not feel like
you're really the boss, right? But you are, and there's
a power dynamic there that's simply not there for other couples. If you really believe there is a sincere,
honestly felt, personal connection that would be lasting and meaningful, one of you may need to move, and it shouldn't always be the person
who's lower in the company pecking order. 02:29Question four: I've just started seeing a coworker. How do we handle things? I get this question a lot. ""Are they dating? Are they not dating?"" Don't keep it a secret. You don't have to make a big deal of it,
but secrecy tends to be corrosive. People tend to see workplace couples
as a coalition or a unit, so try to make it clear to your coworkers
that you're not the same person; you love each other,
but you are going to disagree. 02:53Question five: Why are coworkers
often attracted to each other? Well, the obvious answer is people
tend to be attracted to each other the more time they spend together. But there's another ingredient
that has to be added: attraction tends to happen when there's work that demands
close collaboration. So imagine you have a big group project
with a tight deadline and you're working late nights
and brainstorming ideas. You look up, and across the table, one of your colleagues throws out
a really great idea. You may feel something,
and that's natural. We call this task interdependence. It's a ripe ground for attraction. The second reason why people at work
are attracted to each other is they may often be
similar to each other. There's two old adages: ""Birds of a feather flock together.""
And ""Opposites attract."" Well, the psychological
research suggests ... birds of a feather flock together, and we like people who are like us. 03:48Question six: My coworkers are flirting. I'm annoyed. What do I do? Some researchers argue
that for people flirting at work, flirting is good and it boosts creativity. But my own research suggests
things are different for people who are watching
or who are subjected to the flirting. It can be awkward, right? Witnessing flirtation in the workplace
creates a sense of not knowing the rules, not knowing what's going on, or maybe seeing something
that you shouldn't be seeing. People who frequently witness
flirting at work -- they actually report feeling
less satisfied in their jobs, and they feel less valued
by their company. They're more likely to give a negative
appraisal of the work environment, and they may even consider leaving. For women, this association
can be even stronger. This appears to be the case even when people report
not being bothered by the flirting. It's true even when they say
they enjoy it. So, a flirtatious environment
really could be toxic. 04:44Question seven: Do I need a policy
on workplace relationships? You certainly need a policy
on a sexual harassment, and I think most HR departments
recognize that. But for the kind of consensual
behavior we've been talking about, it's a little different. As much as people in HR
would love to wave a magic wand and say, ""Thou shall not
fall in love at work,"" it's just not realistic. Emotional connection
and sexuality is who we are. I kind of want you
to flip the script a little bit. I encourage HR
to really think more broadly about their role in not necessarily
stamping out office romance, because I don't think that's realistic, but how do I help create
a workplace climate and culture where people feel respected
for their individual contributions, not for their appearance or their gender, or their personal relationships? So the larger question is, how do you make sure
people are valued and respected?"
1,How to avoid catching prickly emotions from other people,Jessica Garza,Jan 2021,"Difficult emotions can get under your skin if you're not careful. Sport and performance consultant Jessica Garza calls this the ""jumping cholla effect,"" inspired by a sneaky kind of cactus that detaches and burrows its spines into unsuspecting passersby. In this empowering talk, she shares four mood-regulating strategies to help you gain self-awareness of your feelings, avoid catching other people's emotions and perform at your peak -- whatever the prickly situation may be.", (54K),"Transcript (7 Languages)EnglishEspañolFrançaisالعربية中文 (简体)中文 (繁體)한국어Leslie Gauthier, TranslatorJoanna Pietrulewicz, Reviewer00:00So I'm a sports
and performance psychologist, which means I get to work
with a lot of people like elite athletes, military professionals and top government agencies, whose career and safety
depend on peak performance. And I'll never forget
this one story a soldier told me about his time serving in Iraq. It was around the early 2000s when the United States had military
operations in both Iraq and Afghanistan. And during this time, many locals were encouraged
to come forward and share information
about potential threats. So one day this Iraqi man
approaches the gate of a US outpost to share intelligence
about a possible threat. But instead of being treated like an ally, he was met with hostility
by the soldier who was debriefing him. But that's likely because
just days earlier, soldiers from another unit
were killed in a surprise attack. And so as the interview continued,
so did the soldier's irritation. And as a result,
the Iraqi man became frustrated. In the end, tempers were flaring so high
that the interview was cut short, and the following day, two separate units were hit
by roadside bombs. 01:05Of course we'll never know for sure
if the attacks could have been stopped had the interview gone differently, but the reason why
I'm telling you this story is because it's an excellent example
of a supercommon problem that keeps so many of us
from performing at our best. And it's how well we're able
to regulate our emotions, which is one of the most common
drivers of a good and bad performance. And it turns out how well you're able
to regulate your emotions depends on how susceptible you are
to a principle called emotional contagion. 01:36It's just like it sounds. It's how quickly you can catch
the emotions of other people and then take them on as your own. The problem is though, most of us are highly susceptible
to other people's emotions, which means even the smallest
external factor can impact how we perform at work, on the field, and even at home. But lucky for us, we can learn how to avoid
other people's emotions by becoming better at regulating our own. 02:05So here's how I like to think about this. Take a look. Now at a glance, this looks like a giant,
teddy bear-looking shrub, right? I remember seeing one of these
for the very first time while hiking in Arizona, and because it looked soft, I reached out to touch it. But by the time my hand was close enough, the spines on the branches
jumped and pricked me -- literally, my hand was covered. And every time I tried to remove one, that little sucker would break off and it would burrow deeper into my skin, just like the guy in the video. 02:35(Video) Man: Argh! 02:37Jessica Garza: And this plant -- 
it has the perfect name. It's called the jumping cholla, and it left a lasting impression -- figuratively and literally. So much so that when I teach people
how to regulate their emotions and avoid catching
the emotions of other people, I refer to the ""jumping cholla effect."" And over the years, I have concluded that the jumping chollas
are just like people. They can be pricks, and if you're not careful,
they can borrow deep into your skin. 03:09So to understand
how this happens in real life, I think it's helpful to know
what emotions actually are. And there's two popular theories
about where emotions come from. The first theory is called
cognitive appraisal, which basically says that the experience of an emotion
is actually you evaluating if your current situation
aligns with your goals or expectations. So let's say you're on your way home
to share some exciting news with your significant other. You walk through the door,
you find them sitting on the couch, but instead of a hello
or ""how was your day?"" they leave the room without saying a word. Now, that's not how you expected
your evening to go, which could lead to the emotion
of feeling annoyed. Does that make sense? 03:52The other theory is called
physiological perception, which is all about the emotions
we subconsciously assign to the physical changes in our body. Public speaking is a great way
to understand this. How perfect, right? Usually, right before I speak
I get butterflies in my stomach. Now, if I had that same physical feeling
the last time I spoke in public and the speech went well, I may interpret that situation
or that sensation as the emotion of excitement. But let's just say
I bombed my last speech. I may now interpret that butterfly feeling
as nervousness or fear. Basically, we overlay
our physiological perception from our past experiences onto our current situation. And what's interesting
is that both of these theories also play into how we assess
the emotions of other people. Because the part of the brain
that processes emotion and memory -- the limbic system -- is considered to be an open-loop system, which means it can be influenced
by any external factor. 04:58Think about it: have you ever passed by someone, and without saying a word, you could feel how annoyed
or how excited they were? And then maybe you felt
annoyed or excited too. It's an interesting
concept to think about, because our brains are hardwired to pick up these subtle cues
in our environment, which makes it possible
for the other person's emotions to jump and attach to you. But what many people don't realize is that every human being
is affected by our open-loop system. Many people at work
or many people on the same team inevitably catch feelings
from one another, sharing everything from jealousy
to envy and worry to joy. The more cohesive the group,
the stronger the sharing of moods. 05:39And we see this play out
in sports all the time. And sometimes even in a good way, like if the team is getting beat but the captain regulates
his or her emotions and stays grounded and present, that can increase the likelihood that the rest of the team
will stay grounded and present as well -- which is great when it happens, but all it takes is for one person
on that team to express a negative emotion for the whole thing to fall apart. Now take a moment and think about
how long you've held onto an irritation, especially after an encounter
from a prickly person. Was it days? Weeks? Months? Man, I had this one boss, who I let his negative emotions
jump and attach to me. And I held onto them for a year -- literally a year. And when I think back now, I can't help but cringe
because of all the productivity lost and the amount of stress that I felt all because my boss and I
caught each other's frustrations and couldn't escape the cycle
of the jumping cholla effect. 06:43But the ideal situation, which improves team and group dynamics
as well as individual happiness, is for everyone to control
their emotional state by sending back the other person's
emotions to them. And research shows that there's two
common emotion regulation strategies that can help. And I use both of these
with my clients all the time. Do you remember cognitive appraisal where you assign meaning to a situation
based on your goals and expectations? Well, the first strategy is called
cognitive reappraisal, where you work to reframe
how you interpret the situation in order to regulate your emotions. It's like taking active steps
to reevaluate your hiking path in order to avoid the jumping cholla. 07:26Let me give you an example. So I once had this soldier who was training
to become an interrogator. And every time he got feedback,
he immediately became defensive and then would justify his behavior. Eventually he told me
that he acted that way because he thought his instructor
just didn't like him. So with the use of cognitive reappraisal, he was taught to actively pause
and reframe his interpretation and expectation of the situation. So if he thought ""my instructor hates me, he always looks upset,"" he would reframe that thought to ""he may look upset but he takes the time
to walk me through what I need to fix."" Now training your brain
to reframe takes time, and sometimes it's not easy because there's a hint of truth
within each of our thoughts. But if you work consistently on reframing, you'll be able to engage prickly people
without being negatively affected by the other person's mood. 08:23Acceptance is the other
emotion regulation strategy. It means what you think. It's learning to accept
a moment for what it is and not for what you want it to be. And when I teach people how to do this,
I use a three-step framework: ""OK; so what; now what."" By saying ""OK,"" you halt
any additional judgment to the person or to the situation. You then allow yourself space
to accept your physiological responses and your perception to what's happening. And once you've distanced yourself
from your thoughts and your emotional state, then you can say, ""so what"" because this helps acknowledge
what happened purely as an event. And as you transition into ""now what"" that means that you've gathered
enough information to be able to respond to the event. Now most people can get to ""OK,"" but struggle to get past ""so what""
because it can be difficult to detach our physiological
perception from the situation. But here's what I tell
people to keep in mind. Acceptance doesn't mean
that you're OK with what happened or that you even want it to continue. It means that you're able to take
an aerial shot of the exchange and understand
where the prickly spines are and if they're worth attaching to. 09:41Now, both of these strategies
are my favorite because they're so powerful, especially on the effects that they have
on how we approach life and relationships. And one study even suggests that cognitive reappraisal
tends to be associated with more immediate emotional relief
in negative situations, whereas acceptance may be better suited for decreasing short-term physiological
reactions in unpleasant situations. But the best part? Both of these strategies
don't have to be separate practices. Acceptance and cognitive reappraisal
can be used interchangeably in order to maintain
emotional self-control. The key though to implementing them
is to become self-aware when you become emotionally
triggered by another person or event. And once you've consciously become aware
of either your thoughts, emotions or physical sensations, well then you can practice
either technique. These may be common concepts, but I'll tell you they're definitely
not commonly practiced. So by remembering
the jumping cholla effect, it will help you to be more
self-aware and self-regulated. And in turn, well,
you'll avoid getting pricked by ... a prick. 10:53Thank you."
2,How to have constructive conversations,Julia Dhar,Mar 2021,"""We need to figure out how we go into conversations not looking for the victory, but the progress,"" says world debate champion Julia Dhar. In this practical talk, she shares three essential features of productive disagreements grounded in curiosity and purpose. The end result? Constructive conversations that sharpen your argument and strengthen your relationships.", (79K),"Transcript (20 Languages)Bahasa IndonesiaEnglishEspañolFrançaisLietuvių kalbaMagyarPolskiPortuguês brasileiroPortuguês de PortugalSvenskaTiếng ViệtTürkçeΕλληνικάРусскийעבריתالعربيةفارسى中文 (简体)中文 (繁體)日本語00:00Three planes, 25 hours, 10,000 miles. My dad gets off a flight from Australia
with one thing in mind and it's not a snack or a shower or a nap. It's November 2016 and Dad is here to talk to Americans
about the election. Now, Dad's a news fiend, but for him, this is not just red or blue,
swing states or party platforms. He has some really specific intentions. He wants to listen,
be heard and understand. 00:31And over two weeks,
he has hundreds of conversations with Americans from
New Hampshire to Miami. Some of them are tough conversations, complete differences of opinions, wildly different worldviews, radically opposite life experiences. But in all of those interactions, Dad walks away
with a big smile on his face and so does the other person. You can see one of them here. And in those interactions, he's having a version
of what it seems like we have less of, but want more of -- a constructive conversation. 01:09We have more ways than ever to connect. And yet, politically, ideologically, it feels like we are further
and further apart. We tell pollsters that we want
politicians who are open-minded. And yet when they change
their point of view, we say that they lacked conviction. For us, when we're confronted
with information that challenges an existing worldview, our tendency is not to open up,
it's to double down. We even have a term for it
in social psychology. It's called belief perseverance. And boy, do some people's beliefs
seem to persevere. 01:50I'm no stranger to tough conversations. I got my start in what I now call
productive disagreement in high school debate. I even went on to win the World Schools Debate
Championship three times. I've been in a lot of arguments,
is what I'm saying, but it took watching my dad
on the streets of the US to understand
that we need to figure out how we go into conversations. Not looking for the victory,
but the progress. 02:19And so since November 2016,
that's what I've been doing. Working with governments,
foundations, corporations, families, to uncover the tools and techniques that allow us to talk when it feels
like the divide is unbridgeable. And constructive conversations
that really move the dialogue forward have these same three essential features. 02:43First, at least one party
in the conversation is willing to choose curiosity over clash. They're open to the idea
that the discussion is a climbing wall, not a cage fight, that they'll make progress over time and are able to anchor all of that
in purpose of the discussion. For someone trained in formal debate, it is so tempting to run headlong
at the disagreement. In fact, we call that clash and in formal argumentation, it's a punishable offense
if there's not enough of it. But I've noticed,
you've probably noticed, too, that in real life that tends
to make people shut down, not just from the conversation, but even from the relationship. It's actually one of the causes
of unfriending, online and off. 03:40So instead, you might consider a technique made popular by the Hollywood
producer Brian Grazer, the curiosity conversation. And the whole point
of a curiosity conversation is to understand
the other person's perspective, to see what's on their side of the fence. And so the next time that someone says something
you instinctively disagree with, that you react violently to, you only need one sentence
and one question: “I never thought about it
exactly that way before. What can you share
that would help me see what you see?” What's remarkable
about curiosity conversations is that the people you are curious about
tend to become curious about you. Whether it's a friendly
Australian gentleman, a political foe or a corporate rival, they begin to wonder
what it is that you see and whether they could see it to. 04:42Constructive conversations
aren't a one-shot deal. If you go into an encounter
expecting everyone to walk out with the same point of view
that you walked in with, there's really no chance for progress. Instead, we need to think
about conversations as a climbing wall to do a variant of what
my dad did during this trip, pocketing a little nugget
of information here, adapting his approach there. That's actually a technique
borrowed from formal debate where you present an idea, it's attacked and you adapt
and re-explain, it's attacked again, you adapt and re-explain. The whole expectation
is that your idea gets better through challenge and criticism. 05:31And the evidence from really high-stakes
international negotiations suggests that that's what successful
negotiators do as well. They go into conversations expecting to learn from the challenges
that they will receive to use objections to make their ideas
and proposals better. Development is in some way a service
that we can do for others and that others can do for us. It makes the ideas sharper, but the relationships warmer. Curiosity can be relationship magic and development can be
rocket fuel for your ideas. 06:12But there are some situations where it just feels
like it's not worth the bother. And in those cases it can be because the purpose
of the discussion isn't clear. I think back to how my dad
went into those conversations with a really clear sense of purpose. He was there to learn, to listen,
to share his point of view. And once that purpose
is understood by both parties, then you can begin to move on. Lay out our vision for the future. Make a decision. Get funding. Then you can move on to principles. 06:52When people shared with my dad
their hopes for America, that's where they started
with the big picture, not with personality
or politics or policies. Because inadvertently
they were doing something that we do naturally with outsiders and find it really difficult sometimes
to do with insiders. They painted in broad strokes before digging into the details. 07:24But maybe you live in the same
zip code or the same house and it feels like none
of that common ground is there today. Then you might consider a version
of disagreement time travel, asking your counterpart to articulate
what kind of neighborhood, country, world, community, they want a year from now, a decade from now. It is very tempting
to dwell in present tensions and get bogged down in practicalities. Inviting people to inhabit
a future possibility opens up the chance
of a conversation with purpose. 08:06Earlier in my career, I worked for the deputy
prime minister of New Zealand who practiced a version of this technique. New Zealand's electoral system
is designed for unlikely friendships, coalitions, alliances, memoranda of understanding
are almost inevitable. And this particular government set-up
had some of almost everything -- small government conservatives, liberals, the Indigenous people's party,
the Green Party. And I recently asked him, what does it take to bring
a group like that together but hold them together? He said, ""Someone, you,
has to take responsibility for reminding them
of their shared purpose: caring for people.” If we are more focused
on what makes us different than the same, then every debate is a fight. If we put our challenges
and our problems before us, then every potential ally
becomes an adversary. 09:11But as my dad packed his bags
for the three flights, 25 hours, 10,000 miles back to Australia, he was also packing a collection
of new perspectives, a new way of navigating conversations, and a whole set of new stories
and experiences to share. But he was also leaving those behind with everyone that he'd interacted with. We love unlikely friendships
when they look like this. We've just forgotten how to make them. And amid the cacophony of cable news and the awkwardness of family dinners, and the hostility of corporate meetings, each of us has this -- the opportunity
to walk into every encounter, like my dad walked off that plane, to choose curiosity over clash, to expect development
of your ideas through discussion and to anchor in common purpose. That's what really
world-class persuaders do to build constructive conversations and move them forward. It's how our world will move forward too. 10:25Thank you."

with Difficult Feelings. I’m your host, Cloe Shasha Brooks,
and a curator at TED. This past year has been full
of both personal and collective grief. And this grief has taken many forms. And to dive deeper into the world
of understanding and managing grief, I'll be speaking first
with Nina Westbrook, a marriage and family therapist
who has supported clients through loss. Hi, Nina. 00:34Nina Westbrook: Hi, Cloe,
good to see you. Thank you so much for having me. 00:39CSB: Thanks for joining us. Nina, you have talked about how grief
can be about the loss of people and tangible things. But that it can also be
about the loss of dreams, something that many people
have experienced over the past year. Can you give me some examples
of grieving for lost dreams and talk about what it means
to experience this kind of grief? 00:59NW: Absolutely. I believe that grief can take
so many different forms, and I think oftentimes
when we think about grief, we associate it with the emotional process that takes place when we're coping
with the death of a loved one. I don't know. It's just not as common to associate grief or correlate grief
with the loss of a dream. So when you think about dreams
and when they begin and how deeply they're rooted
into our daily lives and our routines and how much our dreams determine our decision-making process and the choices that we make
throughout the course of our lives, they hold a pretty significant
amount of space in our minds and in our hearts. Imagine a child who, you know, from a young age,
we begin to dream and they begin to dream
about becoming an astronaut one day and walking on the moon
or becoming a professional athlete. And then as we grow older, we begin to focus in
on what our needs are and what our wants are, and our dreams begin to look more
like acquiring our dream careers or job positions or opening businesses, having children or finding love. And the reality is that these dreams
do not always work out and manifest themselves in a way
that we have imagined, right? And that can be so devastating
for so many people. The loss of careers and jobs or our divorces,
the loss of relationships, or infertility can all be
extremely devastating things and those types of devastating events propel you into the emotional process that takes place during grief. 02:59CSB: Let's bring a question up
from the audience. What are comforting things to do
or say when someone is grieving? So I guess someone else in this case. 03:07NW: That's a really amazing question. A lot of the time, simply being present and offering support and encouragement is really going to be important when you're trying to support
someone else through their grief. I think communication is also important, asking that person, ""What can I do,"" or ""What do you need
from me in this moment and how can I best support you,"" is kind of going to be the best way
to figure out how to support this person. Sometimes they just want
someone to listen to. Sometimes they need someone
to make them laugh or to help, you know, keep them distracted for a moment or sometimes they just need someone
to be around them. It just really depends on the person, since grief is so subjective
in the way that we go through it. 04:01CSB: Totally. And let's go right
into some strategies, too. So I'm sure you have strategies
for managing the grief of lost dreams. How do people pick themselves
back up after that? 04:13NW: You want to give yourself
permission to grieve, first off. And it's not a linear journey, there is going to be lots of ups
and downs that take place. Some days you're going to be OK
and some days you might cry and sometimes you might go
a month without crying. And then one day everything comes
crashing down all at once. It's just a matter of giving yourself
permission to go through these feelings and knowing and reassuring yourself
that this is OK and it's normal. And also keeping in mind that it's OK to feel joy
even in those moments of sadness that you're going to experience
when you're grieving. The other thing that I think
is really important is just to be proactive
in the grieving process. Don't ignore your grief. You can seek support. You can't be afraid to ask for support or lean on others, people that you trust, friends, family members, coworkers,
whomever it may be for support. And then making a plan, making a new plan. Mourning happens over time. What it's doing, what we're doing, and all of the emotions
that were going through during that mourning process is we're literally detaching ourselves
emotionally from the dream that we are mourning or from the object that we're mourning. And what that's doing
is opening yourself up and making space for new dreams and new experiences
and new opportunities in the future. So goal setting and planning
is going to be key. A lot of the time
we really focus on plan A. So this is a great time to pivot and focus on planning
for a new future and a new outcome. 06:08CSB: Absolutely. And just one final quick question for you, which is that sometimes people
get mad at themselves for not getting over their grief. What would you say to those people? 06:18NW: It's really important to keep healing
at the forefront of your mind. And I think that understanding
the grief process and going through the ups and downs and knowing that that's all a part of it, you have to be patient with yourself, you have to give yourself grace and understand that you're
going to have good days, you're going to have bad days. But when it all comes down to it, if you're keeping the idea
of healing in the forefront, then you can focus your energy

1,Rethinking infidelity ... a talk for anyone who has ever loved,Esther Perel,May 2015,"Infidelity is the ultimate betrayal. But does it have to be? Relationship therapist Esther Perel examines why people cheat, and unpacks why affairs are so traumatic: because they threaten our emotional security.

And why do happy people cheat? And when we say ""infidelity,""
what exactly do we mean? Is it a hookup, a love story,
paid sex, a chat room, a massage with a happy ending? Why do we think that men cheat
out of boredom and fear of intimacy, but women cheat out of loneliness
and hunger for intimacy? And is an affair always
the end of a relationship? 00:41For the past 10 years,
I have traveled the globe and worked extensively
with hundreds of couples who have been shattered by infidelity. There is one simple act of transgression that can rob a couple
of their relationship, their happiness and their
very identity: an affair. And yet, this extremely common
act is so poorly understood. So this talk is for anyone
who has ever loved. 01:17Adultery has existed
since marriage was invented, and so, too, the taboo against it. In fact, infidelity has a tenacity
that marriage can only envy, so much so, that this is
the only commandment that is repeated twice in the Bible: once for doing it, and once
just for thinking about it. (Laughter) So how do we reconcile
what is universally forbidden, yet universally practiced? 01:53Now, throughout history, men
practically had a license to cheat with little consequence, and supported by a host
of biological and evolutionary theories that justified their need to roam, so the double standard
is as old as adultery itself. But who knows what's really going on
under the sheets there, right? Because when it comes to sex, the pressure for men
is to boast and to exaggerate, but the pressure for women
is to hide, minimize and deny, which isn't surprising when you consider
that there are still nine countries where women can be killed for straying. 02:37Now, monogamy used to be
one person for life. Today, monogamy is one person at a time. (Laughter) (Applause) 02:52I mean, many of you probably have said, ""I am monogamous in all my relationships."" (Laughter) 03:00We used to marry, and had sex for the first time. But now we marry, and we stop having sex with others. The fact is that monogamy
had nothing to do with love. Men relied on women's fidelity in order to know whose children these are, and who gets the cows when I die. 03:24Now, everyone wants to know what percentage of people cheat. I've been asked that question
since I arrived at this conference. (Laughter) It applies to you. But the definition of infidelity
keeps on expanding: sexting, watching porn, staying
secretly active on dating apps. So because there is no
universally agreed-upon definition of what even constitutes an infidelity, estimates vary widely,
from 26 percent to 75 percent. But on top of it, we are
walking contradictions. So 95 percent of us will say
that it is terribly wrong for our partner to lie
about having an affair, but just about the same
amount of us will say that that's exactly what we
would do if we were having one. (Laughter) 04:19Now, I like this definition
of an affair -- it brings together the three key elements: a secretive relationship,
which is the core structure of an affair; an emotional connection
to one degree or another; and a sexual alchemy. And alchemy is the key word here, because the erotic frisson is such that
the kiss that you only imagine giving, can be as powerful and as enchanting as hours of actual lovemaking. As Marcel Proust said, it's our imagination that is responsible
for love, not the other person. 05:05So it's never been easier to cheat, and it's never been more
difficult to keep a secret. And never has infidelity exacted
such a psychological toll. When marriage was an economic enterprise, infidelity threatened
our economic security. But now that marriage
is a romantic arrangement, infidelity threatens
our emotional security. Ironically, we used to turn to adultery -- that was the space where
we sought pure love. But now that we seek love in marriage, adultery destroys it. 05:46Now, there are three ways that I think
infidelity hurts differently today. We have a romantic ideal
in which we turn to one person to fulfill an endless list of needs: to be my greatest lover, my best friend, the best parent, my trusted confidant, my emotional companion,
my intellectual equal. And I am it: I'm chosen, I'm unique, I'm indispensable, I'm irreplaceable, I'm the one. And infidelity tells me I'm not. It is the ultimate betrayal. Infidelity shatters
the grand ambition of love. But if throughout history,
infidelity has always been painful, today it is often traumatic, because it threatens our sense of self. 06:45So my patient Fernando, he's plagued. He goes on: ""I thought I knew my life. I thought I knew who you were,
who we were as a couple, who I was. Now, I question everything."" Infidelity -- a violation of trust,
a crisis of identity. ""Can I ever trust you again?"" he asks. ""Can I ever trust anyone again?"" 07:08And this is also what my patient
Heather is telling me, when she's talking to me
about her story with Nick. Married, two kids. Nick just left on a business trip, and Heather is playing
on his iPad with the boys, when she sees a message
appear on the screen: ""Can't wait to see you."" Strange, she thinks,
we just saw each other. And then another message: ""Can't wait to hold you in my arms."" And Heather realizes these are not for her. She also tells me
that her father had affairs, but her mother, she found
one little receipt in the pocket, and a little bit of lipstick
on the collar. Heather, she goes digging, and she finds hundreds of messages, and photos exchanged
and desires expressed. The vivid details
of Nick's two-year affair unfold in front of her in real time, And it made me think: Affairs in the digital age
are death by a thousand cuts. 08:15But then we have another paradox
that we're dealing with these days. Because of this romantic ideal, we are relying on our partner's
fidelity with a unique fervor. But we also have never
been more inclined to stray, and not because we have new desires today, but because we live in an era where we feel that we are
entitled to pursue our desires, because this is the culture
where I deserve to be happy. And if we used to divorce
because we were unhappy, today we divorce
because we could be happier. And if divorce carried all the shame, today, choosing to stay when you can leave is the new shame. So Heather, she can't talk to her friends because she's afraid that they
will judge her for still loving Nick, and everywhere she turns,
she gets the same advice: Leave him. Throw the dog on the curb. And if the situation were reversed,
Nick would be in the same situation. Staying is the new shame. 09:23So if we can divorce, why do we still have affairs? Now, the typical assumption
is that if someone cheats, either there's something wrong
in your relationship or wrong with you. But millions of people
can't all be pathological. The logic goes like this: If you
have everything you need at home, then there is no need
to go looking elsewhere, assuming that there is such
a thing as a perfect marriage that will inoculate us against wanderlust. But what if passion
has a finite shelf life? What if there are things
that even a good relationship can never provide? If even happy people cheat, what is it about? 10:16The vast majority of people
that I actually work with are not at all chronic philanderers. They are often people who are
deeply monogamous in their beliefs, and at least for their partner. But they find themselves in a conflict between their values and their behavior. They often are people who have
actually been faithful for decades, but one day they cross a line that they never thought they would cross, and at the risk of losing everything. But for a glimmer of what? Affairs are an act of betrayal, and they are also an expression
of longing and loss. At the heart of an affair,
you will often find a longing and a yearning
for an emotional connection, for novelty, for freedom,
for autonomy, for sexual intensity, a wish to recapture
lost parts of ourselves or an attempt to bring back
vitality in the face of loss and tragedy. 11:22I'm thinking about
another patient of mine, Priya, who is blissfully married, loves her husband, and would never want to hurt the man. But she also tells me that she's always done
what was expected of her: good girl, good wife, good mother, taking care of her immigrant parents. Priya, she fell for the arborist
who removed the tree from her yard after Hurricane Sandy. And with his truck and his tattoos,
he's quite the opposite of her. But at 47, Priya's affair is about
the adolescence that she never had. And her story highlights for me
that when we seek the gaze of another, it isn't always our partner
that we are turning away from, but the person that
we have ourselves become. And it isn't so much that we're
looking for another person, as much as we are
looking for another self. 12:27Now, all over the world, there is one word that people
who have affairs always tell me. They feel alive. And they often will tell me
stories of recent losses -- of a parent who died, and a friend that went too soon, and bad news at the doctor. Death and mortality often live
in the shadow of an affair, because they raise these questions. Is this it? Is there more? Am I going on for another
25 years like this? Will I ever feel that thing again? And it has led me to think
that perhaps these questions are the ones that propel
people to cross the line, and that some affairs are
an attempt to beat back deadness, in an antidote to death. 13:21And contrary to what you may think, affairs are way less about sex,
and a lot more about desire: desire for attention,
desire to feel special, desire to feel important. And the very structure of an affair, the fact that you can
never have your lover, keeps you wanting. That in itself is a desire machine, because the incompleteness, the ambiguity, keeps you wanting
that which you can't have. 13:53Now some of you probably think that affairs don't happen
in open relationships, but they do. First of all, the conversation
about monogamy is not the same as the conversation about infidelity. But the fact is that it seems
that even when we have the freedom to have other sexual partners, we still seem to be lured
by the power of the forbidden, that if we do that which
we are not supposed to do, then we feel like we are really
doing what we want to. And I've also told
quite a few of my patients that if they could bring
into their relationships one tenth of the boldness,
the imagination and the verve that they put into their affairs, they probably would never need to see me. (Laughter) 14:44So how do we heal from an affair? Desire runs deep. Betrayal runs deep. But it can be healed. And some affairs are death knells for relationships that were
already dying on the vine. But others will jolt us
into new possibilities. The fact is, the majority of couples who have experienced
affairs stay together. But some of them will merely survive, and others will actually be able
to turn a crisis into an opportunity. They'll be able to turn this
into a generative experience. And I'm actually thinking even
more so for the deceived partner, who will often say, ""You think I didn't want more? But I'm not the one who did it."" But now that the affair is exposed, they, too, get to claim more, and they no longer have
to uphold the status quo that may not have been working
for them that well, either. 15:44I've noticed that a lot of couples, in the immediate aftermath of an affair, because of this new disorder
that may actually lead to a new order, will have depths of conversations
with honesty and openness that they haven't had in decades. And, partners who were
sexually indifferent find themselves suddenly
so lustfully voracious, they don't know where it's coming from. Something about the fear
of loss will rekindle desire, and make way for an entirely
new kind of truth. 16:18So when an affair is exposed, what are some of the specific things
that couples can do? We know from trauma that healing begins when the perpetrator
acknowledges their wrongdoing. So for the partner who had the affair, for Nick, one thing is to end the affair, but the other is the essential,
important act of expressing guilt and remorse for hurting his wife. But the truth is that I have noticed that quite a lot
of people who have affairs may feel terribly guilty
for hurting their partner, but they don't feel guilty
for the experience of the affair itself. And that distinction is important. And Nick, he needs to hold
vigil for the relationship. He needs to become, for a while,
the protector of the boundaries. It's his responsibility to bring it up, because if he thinks about it, he can relieve Heather from the obsession, and from having to make sure
that the affair isn't forgotten, and that in itself
begins to restore trust. 17:27But for Heather, or deceived partners, it is essential to do things
that bring back a sense of self-worth, to surround oneself with love
and with friends and activities that give back joy
and meaning and identity. But even more important, is to curb the curiosity
to mine for the sordid details -- Where were you? Where did you do it? How often? Is she better
than me in bed? -- questions that only inflict more pain, and keep you awake at night. And instead, switch to what I call
the investigative questions, the ones that mine
the meaning and the motives -- What did this affair mean for you? What were you able to express
or experience there that you could no longer do with me? What was it like for you
when you came home? What is it about us that you value? Are you pleased this is over? 18:26Every affair will redefine a relationship, and every couple will determine what the legacy of the affair will be. But affairs are here to stay,
and they're not going away. And the dilemmas of love and desire, they don't yield just simple answers
of black and white and good and bad, and victim and perpetrator. Betrayal in a relationship
comes in many forms. There are many ways
that we betray our partner: with contempt, with neglect, with indifference, with violence. Sexual betrayal is only
one way to hurt a partner. In other words, the victim of an affair is not always the victim of the marriage. 19:17Now, you've listened to me, and I know what you're thinking: She has a French accent,
she must be pro-affair. (Laughter) So, you're wrong. I am not French. (Laughter) (Applause) And I'm not pro-affair. But because I think that good
can come out of an affair, I have often been asked
this very strange question: Would I ever recommend it? Now, I would no more
recommend you have an affair than I would recommend you have cancer, and yet we know that people
who have been ill often talk about how their illness
has yielded them a new perspective. The main question that I've been asked
since I arrived at this conference when I said I would talk
about infidelity is, for or against? I said, ""Yes."" (Laughter) 20:21I look at affairs from a dual perspective: hurt and betrayal on one side, growth and self-discovery on the other -- what it did to you,
and what it meant for me. And so when a couple comes to me
in the aftermath of an affair that has been revealed, I will often tell them this: Today in the West, most of us are going to have
two or three relationships or marriages, and some of us are going
to do it with the same person. Your first marriage is over. Would you like to create
a second one together? 21:05Thank you. 21:06(Applause)"
1,The emotions behind your money habits,Robert A. Belle,Jun 2021,"Your money habits reveal a lot about you: your hopes, fears, dreams and other deep personal truths you may not even be aware of, says accountant Robert A. Belle. He shares how taking stock of your transaction history can unlock surprisingly valuable insights about what drives you to spend (and save) -- and provides practical tips on how to perform an ""emotional audit"" of your expenses.", (62K),"Transcript (18 Languages)Bahasa IndonesiaBahasa melayuCatalàEnglishEspañolFrançaisMagyarPolskiPortuguês brasileiroPortuguês de PortugalTiếng ViệtΕλληνικάРусскийעבריתالعربيةภาษาไทย中文 (简体)中文 (繁體)00:01I am an accountant with a numbers problem. I mean, I'm good with numbers
and using them to report what's happening, but I'm also concerned
with the full story behind those numbers, the part that gets lost in translation, the part that numbers can't quite tell, the story that goes deeper than mere strategies
for saving and earning money. And without that story,
I don't think I'm doing my job well. That's why I've dedicated my career to figuring out how my work
as an accountant can tell stories about people, stories that will ultimately
help them improve their lives. Let me explain. 00:42It all started when someone told me,
""You're obsessed with chocolate."" And I was like, ""What? No, I'm not."" But then I wondered, could I be
in denial about my own obsession? Was I actually spending a lot of money
on chocolate but blind to it? Well, here was a chance
for me to test this theory. Using my accountant lens, off I went tracking
my spending on chocolate -- and there it was, my love for chocolate. I was spending about 50 dollars
a month on chocolate, especially in months
when I was overstressed and months when I was overjoyed. 01:20Analyzing my expenses
helped me to understand that I had an emotional pattern
where when I'm struggling or celebrating, I binge on chocolate. I had struggled with my weight
for a very long time and I was convinced
that my diet was not the problem. I was convinced that it was
my lack of effort in exercise, and certainly not chocolate. Tracking my spending on chocolate, though, helped me realize that I was afraid
of facing myself in the mirror, literally and figuratively, and that I lack the courage
to deal with the real problem, my diet. So I continued to exercise, but devoted less time to it and instead shifted my focus and energy
towards developing a more healthful diet. That year I lost 50 pounds. 02:14Our relationship with money
represents our relationship with life. The accounting
of my own chocolate behavior told me the story of my own denial. I realized that perhaps
I could also help my clients see what they were overlooking
in their own lives and help them realize
their own emotional patterns through their tracking and spending
of their expenses. 02:40So I started to pay close attention
to the story behind my clients' expenses that may be hidden to them. One of my clients, a critical care nurse, was convinced that
her personal budget was reasonable and expenses justifiable. She had struggled to build up her savings and I noticed that she had
minimal records of her expenses. I suggested to her
that her lack of savings could be due to more
than just a gap in her financial knowledge and offered to help identify the problem. I encouraged her to start tracking
and charting her expenses. After a few months,
her financial records revealed that most of her spending
was on expensive clothing and shoes. As we sat together,
she was genuinely surprised to see just how much of her budget
was going towards fashion. She remarked, ""Wow, these are
impulsive purchases, aren't they? I guess I didn't realize that."" 03:42She analyzed further
and realized that she was buying clothes in an attempt to impress
and appear successful to her friends. And also when her confidence was low,
buying clothes temporarily boosted it. She told me that buying clothing
was her attempt to find meaning in life and feel valued. She sighed, and she set a goal
for herself and her finances. Six months later, she called me
to tell me she had saved a bunch of money by reducing her spending on shopping and instead choosing to exercise
when she felt the urge to shop. She's much happier around her friends. Three years later,
home ownership is on the horizon. 04:29Sometimes, though, charting expenses
may not reveal something specific, as a chocolate addiction
or shopping problem, but what it reveals
can be just as valuable. A marketing strategist
and upcoming musician needed help with her taxes. When I met with her, I immediately
took note of the fear in her face as she looked through
her records and expenses. I checked in with her
and she expressed to me that some things in her life
didn't quite seem to work out, including her relationships. She was afraid of facing how much money
she was about to lose after taxes. As we continued talking
about her finances, she started to notice a connection
between her fear of losing money and her fear of losing relationships. She went on to tell me that she was
afraid of committing to anyone because she didn't want to get hurt. She expressed that she had not been
close to anyone in over seven years because she feared failure. And maybe she might have
an avoidance strategy around both her money
and her relationships. 05:42It's been six years since I first
help her chart her finances, and she's still consistently
keeping up with her spreadsheet. As she confronted her personal accounting and grew her savings in advance
of each tax season, she developed less fear of loss
and grew more open to relationships. She tells me that she even has the courage to walk away from a relationship
when it's not serving her. She recently told me, ""My spreadsheet is basically
a story of my life's progression and I can see it through the numbers.” 06:20I believe we can all do this type of audit
of our own financial behavior and that we can learn
surprising things about ourselves through tracking
and charting our expenses. Here's how. Number one, take a look
at your bank statement for the last six months and categorize the expenses by type for a more holistic view. For example, your spending on shopping
versus transport versus entertainment. 06:48Number two, when an expensive
pattern emerges, see what that pattern says about yourself. Be curious and inquisitive. At first, it may not be that obvious, but asking yourself what led you
to make that choice in a given moment can provide some clues. Do you buy pizza every Wednesday night because that's when you're too tired
to cook after a stressful weekly meeting? 07:14Number three, observe
if there are any line items that you are shocked by
in terms of value or volume and see what patterns emerge. For example, did you buy
that new smartphone just before a major function or event so that your friends would notice? Or do you tell yourself
you only take taxis late at night, but then realize that you're taking
way more taxes every month than you thought? Are you working late
more than you thought? 07:44There's so much that we can
learn about ourselves if we take the time to look. And sometimes our money knows us
better than we know ourselves. Tracking our finances
can reveal what we are in denial of, our hidden biases, our fears and what
might be holding us back. Though it can be difficult
and uncomfortable to take a good, hard look
at our financial behavior, it can reveal some deep emotional truths. Some truths that can help us
re-evaluate our careers, our relationships and our priorities. So give it a try.
The payoff could be huge. 08:26Thank you."
1,The journey through loss and grief,Jason B. Rosenthal,Jun 2018,"In her brutally honest, ironically funny and widely read meditation on death, ""You May Want to Marry My Husband,"" the late author and filmmaker Amy Krouse Rosenthal gave her husband Jason very public permission to move on and find happiness. A year after her death, Jason offers candid insights on the often excruciating process of moving through and with loss -- as well as some quiet wisdom for anyone else experiencing life-changing grief.", (72K),"Transcript (20 Languages)Bahasa IndonesiaEnglishEspañolFrançaisMagyarPortuguês brasileiroPortuguês de PortugalRomânăTürkçeΕλληνικάСрпски, Srpskiעבריתالعربيةفارسىहिन्दीภาษาไทย中文 (简体)中文 (繁體)日本語한국어00:01There are three words
that explain why I am here. They are ""Amy Krouse Rosenthal."" 00:11At the end of Amy's life, hyped up on morphine and home in hospice, the ""New York Times""
published an article she wrote for the ""Modern Love"" column
on March 3, 2017. It was read worldwide
by over five million people. The piece was unbearably sad, ironically funny and brutally honest. While it was certainly
about our life together, the focus of the piece was me. It was called, ""You May
Want to Marry My Husband."" It was a creative play
on a personal ad for me. Amy quite literally left
an empty space for me to fill with another love story. 00:55Amy was my wife for half my life. She was my partner in raising
three wonderful, now grown children, and really, she was my girl, you know? We had so much in common. We loved the same art, the same documentaries, the same music. Music was a huge part
of our life together. And we shared the same values. We were in love, and our love grew stronger
up until her last day. Amy was a prolific author. In addition to two groundbreaking memoirs, she published over 30 children's books. Posthumously, the book she wrote
with our daughter Paris, called ""Dear Girl,"" reached the number one position
on the ""New York Times"" bestseller list. She was a self-described tiny filmmaker. She was 5'1"" and her films
were not that long. 01:48(Laughter) 01:49Her films exemplified her natural ability
to gather people together. She was also a terrific public speaker, talking with children
and adults of all ages all over the world. 02:03Now, my story of grief is only unique
in the sense of it being rather public. However, the grieving process itself
was not my story alone. Amy gave me permission to move forward,
and I'm so grateful for that. Now, just a little over a year
into my new life, I've learned a few things. I'm here to share with you
part of the process of moving forward through and with grief. But before I do that,
I think it would be important to talk a little bit
about the end of life, because it forms how I have been
emotionally since then. Death is such a taboo subject, right? 02:42Amy ate her last meal on January 9, 2017. She somehow lived an additional two months without solid food. Her doctors told us
we could do hospice at home or in the hospital. They did not tell us that Amy
would shrink to half her body weight, that she would never lay
with her husband again, and that walking upstairs to our bedroom
would soon feel like running a marathon. Home hospice does have an aura of being
a beautiful environment to die in. How great that you don't have
the sounds of machines beeping and going on and off all the time, no disruptions for mandatory
drug administration, home with your family to die. 03:30We did our best to make those weeks
as meaningful as we could. We talked often about death. Everybody knows it's going
to happen to them, like, for sure, but being able to talk openly
about it was liberating. We talked about subjects like parenting. I asked Amy how I could be the best parent
possible to our children in her absence. In those conversations,
she gave me confidence by stressing what a great relationship
I had with each one of them, and that I can do it. I know there will be many times where I wish she and I
can make decisions together. We were always so in sync. May I be so audacious as to suggest that you have these conversations now, when healthy. Please don't wait. 04:24As part of our hospice experience,
we organized groups of visitors. How brave of Amy to receive them,
even as she began her physical decline. We had a Krouse night, her parents and three siblings. Friends and family were next. Each told beautiful stories
of Amy and of us. Amy made an immense impact
on her loyal friends. 04:48But home hospice is not so beautiful
for the surviving family members. I want to get a little personal here
and tell you that to this date, I have memories of those
final weeks that haunt me. I remember walking backwards
to the bathroom, assisting Amy with each step. I felt so strong. I'm not such a big guy, but my arms looked and felt so healthy
compared to Amy's frail body. And that body failed in our house. On March 13 of last year, my wife died of ovarian cancer in our bed. I carried her lifeless body down our stairs, through our dining room and our living room to a waiting gurney to have her body cremated. I will never get that image
out of my head. If you know someone who has been
through the hospice experience, acknowledge that. Just say you heard this guy Jason talk about how tough it must be
to have those memories and that you're there
if they ever want to talk about it. They may not want to talk, but it's nice to connect with someone
living each day with those lasting images. I know this sounds unbelievable,
but I've never been asked that question. 06:20Amy's essay caused me
to experience grief in a public way. Many of the readers who reached out to me
wrote beautiful words of reflection. The scope of Amy's impact
was deeper and richer than even us and her family knew. Some of the responses I received helped me
with the intense grieving process because of their humor, like this email I received
from a woman reader who read the article, declaring, ""I will marry you when you are ready -- 06:50(Laughter) 06:51""provided you permanently stop drinking. No other conditions. I promise to outlive you. Thank you very much."" 07:02Now, I do like a good tequila,
but that really is not my issue. Yet how could I say no to that proposal? 07:09(Laughter) 07:11I laughed through the tears when I read
this note from a family friend: ""I remember Shabbat dinners at your home and Amy teaching me
how to make cornbread croutons. Only Amy could find
creativity in croutons."" 07:26(Laughter) 07:30On July 27, just a few months
after Amy's death, my dad died of complications related to a decades-long battle
with Parkinson's disease. I had to wonder: How much
can the human condition handle? What makes us capable
of dealing with this intense loss and yet carry on? Was this a test? Why my family and my amazing children? Looking for answers, I regret to say,
is a lifelong mission, but the key to my being able to persevere is Amy's expressed and very public edict that I must go on. Throughout this year,
I have done just that. I have attempted to step out
and seek the joy and the beauty that I know this life
is capable of providing. But here's the reality: those family gatherings, attending weddings
and events honoring Amy, as loving as they are, have all been very difficult to endure. People say I'm amazing. ""How do you handle yourself
that way during those times?"" They say, ""You do it with such grace."" Well, guess what? I really am sad a lot of the time. I often feel like I'm kind of a mess, and I know these feelings
apply to other surviving spouses, children, parents and other family members. 09:04In Japanese Zen, there is a term ""Shoji,"" which translates as ""birth death."" There is no separation
between life and death other than a thin line
that connects the two. Birth, or the joyous,
wonderful, vital parts of life, and death, those things
we want to get rid of, are said to be faced equally. In this new life that I find myself in, I am doing my best to embrace this concept
as I move forward with grieving. 09:35In the early months
following Amy's death, though, I was sure that the feeling of despair
would be ever-present, that it would be all-consuming. Soon I was fortunate
to receive some promising advice. Many members of the losing-a-spouse club reached out to me. One friend in particular who had also
lost her life partner kept repeating, ""Jason, you will find joy."" I didn't even know
what she was talking about. How was that possible? But because Amy gave me
very public permission to also find happiness, I now have experienced joy
from time to time. There it was, dancing the night away
at an LCD Soundsystem concert, traveling with my brother and best friend
or with a college buddy on a boys' trip to meet a group of great guys
I never met before. From observing that my deck had sun
beating down on it on a cold day, stepping out in it, laying there, the warmth consuming my body. The joy comes from my three
stunning children. There was my son Justin, texting me a picture of himself
with an older gentleman with a massive, strong forearm
and the caption, ""I just met Popeye,"" with a huge grin on his face. 10:59(Laughter) 11:01There was his brother Miles,
walking to the train for his first day of work
after graduating college, who stopped and looked
back at me and asked, ""What am I forgetting?"" I assured him right away,
""You are 100 percent ready. You got this."" And my daughter Paris, walking together
through Battersea Park in London, the leaves piled high, the sun glistening in the early morning
on our way to yoga. 11:28I would add that beauty
is also there to discover, and I mean beauty of the wabi-sabi variety but beauty nonetheless. On the one hand, when I see something
in this category, I want to say, ""Amy, did you see that? Did you hear that? It's too beautiful
for you not to share with me."" On the other hand, I now experience these moments in an entirely new way. There was the beauty I found in music, like the moment in the newest
Manchester Orchestra album, when the song ""The Alien"" seamlessly transitions
into ""The Sunshine,"" or the haunting beauty
of Luke Sital-Singh's ""Killing Me,"" whose chorus reads, ""And it's killing me
that you're not here with me. I'm living happily,
but I'm feeling guilty."" There is beauty in the simple moments
that life has to offer, a way of seeing that world
that was so much a part of Amy's DNA, like on my morning commute, looking at the sun
reflecting off of Lake Michigan, or stopping and truly seeing
how the light shines at different times of the day in the house we built together; even after a Chicago storm,
noticing the fresh buildup of snow throughout the neighborhood; or peeking into my daughter's room as she's practicing the bass guitar. 13:01Listen, I want to make it clear
that I'm a very fortunate person. I have the most amazing family
that loves and supports me. I have the resources for personal growth
during my time of grief. But whether it's a divorce, losing a job you worked so hard at or having a family member die suddenly or of a slow-moving and painful death, I would like to offer you what I was given: a blank of sheet of paper. What will you do
with your intentional empty space, with your fresh start? 13:43Thank you. 13:45(Applause)"
2,The lies our culture tells us about what matters — and a better way to live,David Brooks,Jun 2019,"Our society is in the midst of a social crisis, says op-ed columnist and author David Brooks: we're trapped in a valley of isolation and fragmentation. How do we find our way out? Based on his travels across the United States -- and his meetings with a range of exceptional people known as ""weavers"" -- Brooks lays out his vision for a cultural revolution that empowers us all to lead lives of greater meaning, purpose and joy.", (146K),"Transcript (17 Languages)DeutschEnglishEspañolFrançaisMagyarPortuguês brasileiroPortuguês de PortugalRomânăTürkçeРусскийСрпски, Srpskiالعربيةفارسى中文 (简体)中文 (繁體)日本語한국어FootnotesFootnotes00:00So, we all have bad seasons in life. And I had one in 2013. My marriage had just ended, and I was humiliated
by that failed commitment. My kids had left home for college
or were leaving. I grew up mostly
in the conservative movement, but conservatism had changed, so I lost a lot of those friends, too. 00:20And so what I did is,
I lived alone in an apartment, and I just worked. If you opened the kitchen drawers
where there should have been utensils, there were Post-it notes. If you opened the other drawers
where there should have been plates, I had envelopes. I had work friends, weekday friends,
but I didn't have weekend friends. And so my weekends
were these long, howling silences. And I was lonely. And loneliness, unexpectedly,
came to me in the form of -- it felt like fear,
a burning in my stomach. And it felt a little like drunkenness, just making bad decisions,
just fluidity, lack of solidity. And the painful part of that moment
was the awareness that the emptiness in my apartment
was just reflective of the emptiness in myself, and that I had fallen for some of the lies
that our culture tells us. 01:15The first lie is that
career success is fulfilling. I've had a fair bit of career success, and I've found that it helps me avoid
the shame I would feel if I felt myself a failure, but it hasn't given me any positive good. 01:28The second lie is I can make myself happy, that if I just win one more victory, lose 15 pounds, do a little more yoga, I'll get happy. And that's the lie of self-sufficiency. But as anybody
on their deathbed will tell you, the things that make people happy
is the deep relationships of life, the losing of self-sufficiency. 01:51The third lie is the lie
of the meritocracy. The message of the meritocracy
is you are what you accomplish. The myth of the meritocracy
is you can earn dignity by attaching yourself
to prestigious brands. The emotion of the meritocracy
is conditional love, you can ""earn"" your way to love. The anthropology of the meritocracy
is you're not a soul to be purified, you're a set of skills to be maximized. And the evil of the meritocracy is that people who've achieved
a little more than others are actually worth
a little more than others. And so the wages of sin are sin. And my sins were the sins of omission-- not reaching out,
failing to show up for my friends, evasion, avoiding conflict. 02:31And the weird thing was
that as I was falling into the valley -- it was a valley of disconnection -- a lot of other people
were doing that, too. And that's sort of
the secret to my career; a lot of the things that happen to me are always happening
to a lot of other people. I'm a very average person
with above average communication skills. 02:48(Laughter) 02:49footnotefootnoteAnd so I was detached. And at the same time,
a lot of other people were detached and isolated and fragmented
from each other. Thirty-five percent of Americans
over 45 are chronically lonely. Only eight percent of Americans
report having meaningful conversation with their neighbors. Only 32 percent of Americans
say they trust their neighbors, and only 18 percent of millennials. The fastest-growing
political party is unaffiliated. The fastest-growing religious
movement is unaffiliated. Depression rates are rising,
mental health problems are rising. The suicide rate has risen
30 percent since 1999. For teen suicides
over the last several years, the suicide rate has risen by 70 percent. Forty-five thousand Americans
kill themselves every year; 72,000 die from opioid addictions; life expectancy is falling, not rising. 03:36So what I mean to tell you,
I flew out here to say that we have an economic crisis,
we have environmental crisis, we have a political crisis. We also have a social
and relational crisis; we're in the valley. We're fragmented from each other, we've got cascades of lies
coming out of Washington ... We're in the valley. 03:53footnotefootnoteAnd so I've spent the last five years -- how do you get out of a valley? The Greeks used to say,
""You suffer your way to wisdom."" And from that dark period where I started,
I've had a few realizations. The first is, freedom sucks. Economic freedom is OK,
political freedom is great, social freedom sucks. The unrooted man is the adrift man. The unrooted man is the unremembered man,
because he's uncommitted to things. Freedom is not an ocean
you want to swim in, it's a river you want to get across, so you can commit and plant yourself
on the other side. 04:29footnotefootnoteThe second thing I learned is that when you have
one of those bad moments in life, you can either be broken, or you can be broken open. And we all know people who are broken. They've endured some pain
or grief, they get smaller, they get angrier, resentful,
they lash out. As the saying is, ""Pain that is not transformed
gets transmitted."" But other people are broken open. Suffering's great power
is that it's an interruption of life. It reminds you you're not the person
you thought you were. The theologian Paul Tillich said what suffering does is it carves through
what you thought was the floor of the basement of your soul, and it carves through that,
revealing a cavity below, and it carves through that,
revealing a cavity below. You realize there are depths of yourself
you never anticipated, and only spiritual and relational food
will fill those depths. And when you get down there,
you get out of the head of the ego and you get into the heart, the desiring heart. The idea that what we really yearn for
is longing and love for another, the kind of thing that Louis de Bernières
described in his book, ""Captain Corelli's Mandolin."" He had an old guy talking to his daughter about his relationship with his late wife, and the old guy says, ""Love itself is whatever is leftover
when being in love is burned away. And this is both an art
and a fortunate accident. Your mother and I had it. We had roots that grew
towards each other underground, and when all the pretty blossoms
had fallen from our branches, we discovered that we are
one tree and not two."" That's what the heart yearns for. 05:55The second thing
you discover is your soul. Now, I don't ask you to believe in God
or not believe in God, but I do ask you to believe
that there's a piece of you that has no shape, size, color or weight, but that gives you
infinite dignity and value. Rich and successful people
don't have more of this than less successful people. Slavery is wrong because
it's an obliteration of another soul. Rape is not just an attack
on a bunch of physical molecules, it's an attempt to insult
another person's soul. And what the soul does
is it yearns for righteousness. The heart yearns for fusion with another,
the soul yearns for righteousness. And that led to my third realization,
which I borrowed from Einstein: ""The problem you have
is not going to be solved at the level of consciousness
on which you created it. You have to expand
to a different level of consciousness."" 06:42footnotefootnoteSo what do you do? Well, the first thing you do
is you throw yourself on your friends and you have deeper conversations
that you ever had before. But the second thing you do, you have to go out alone
into the wilderness. You go out into that place
where there's nobody there to perform, and the ego has nothing to do,
and it crumbles, and only then are you capable
of being loved. I have a friend who said
that when her daughter was born, she realized that she loved her
more than evolution required. 07:09(Laughter) 07:10And I've always loved that. 07:11(Applause) 07:12Because it talks about the peace
that's at the deep of ourself, our inexplicable care for one another. And when you touch that spot,
you're ready to be rescued. The hard thing about
when you're in the valley is that you can't climb out; somebody has to reach in and pull you out. It happened to me. I got, luckily, invited over to a house
by a couple named Kathy and David, and they were -- They had a kid in the DC
public school, his name's Santi. Santi had a friend
who needed a place to stay because his mom had some health issues. And then that kid had a friend
and that kid had a friend. When I went to their house six years ago, I walk in the door, there's like
25 around the kitchen table, a whole bunch sleeping
downstairs in the basement. I reach out to introduce myself to a kid, and he says, ""We don't really
shake hands here. We just hug here."" And I'm not the huggiest guy
on the face of the earth, but I've been going back to that home
every Thursday night when I'm in town, and just hugging all those kids. They demand intimacy. They demand that you behave in a way
where you're showing all the way up. And they teach you a new way to live, which is the cure
for all the ills of our culture which is a way of direct --
really putting relationship first, not just as a word, but as a reality. 08:25And the beautiful thing is,
these communities are everywhere. I started something at the Aspen Institute
called ""Weave: The Social Fabric."" This is our logo here. And we plop into a place and we find
weavers anywhere, everywhere. We find people like Asiaha Butler,
who grew up in -- who lived in Chicago, in Englewood,
in a tough neighborhood. And she was about to move
because it was so dangerous, and she looked across the street
and she saw two little girls playing in an empty lot
with broken bottles, and she turned to her husband
and she said, ""We're not leaving. We're not going to be just another family
that abandon that."" And she Googled ""volunteer in Englewood,""
and now she runs R.A.G.E., the big community organization there. 09:04Some of these people
have had tough valleys. I met a woman named Sarah in Ohio
who came home from an antiquing trip and found that her husband
had killed himself and their two kids. She now runs a free pharmacy,
she volunteers in the community, she helps women cope
with violence, she teaches. She told me, ""I grew from this
experience because I was angry. I was going to fight back against
what he tried to do to me by making a difference in the world. See, he didn't kill me. My response to him is, 'Whatever you meant to do to me,
screw you, you're not going to do it.'"" 09:38These weavers are not living
an individualistic life, they're living a relationist life,
they have a different set of values. They have moral motivations. They have vocational certitude,
they have planted themselves down. I met a guy in Youngstown, Ohio, who just held up a sign
in the town square, ""Defend Youngstown."" They have radical mutuality, and they are geniuses at relationship. 09:59There's a woman named Mary Gordon who runs something
called Roots of Empathy. And what they do is they take
a bunch of kids, an eighth grade class, they put a mom and an infant, and then the students have to guess
what the infant is thinking, to teach empathy. There was one kid in a class
who was bigger than the rest because he'd been held back,
been through the foster care system, seen his mom get killed. And he wanted to hold the baby. And the mom was nervous
because he looked big and scary. But she let this kid,
Darren, hold the baby. He held it, and he was great with it. He gave the baby back and started
asking questions about parenthood. And his final question was, ""If nobody has ever loved you,
do you think you can be a good father?"" And so what Roots of Empathy does is they reach down and they grab
people out of the valley. And that's what weavers are doing. 10:49Some of them switch jobs. Some of them stay in their same jobs. But one thing is,
they have an intensity to them. I read this -- E.O. Wilson wrote a great book
called ""Naturalist,"" about his childhood. When he was seven,
his parents were divorcing. And they sent him
to Paradise Beach in North Florida. And he'd never seen the ocean before. And he'd never seen a jellyfish before. He wrote, ""The creature was astonishing.
It existed beyond my imagination."" He was sitting on the dock one day and he saw a stingray
float beneath his feet. And at that moment, a naturalist was born
in the awe and wonder. And he makes this observation: that when you're a child, you see animals at twice the size
as you do as an adult. And that has always impressed me, because what we want as kids
is that moral intensity, to be totally given ourselves
over to something and to find that level of vocation. And when you are around these weavers, they see other people
at twice the size as normal people. They see deeper into them. And what they see is joy. 12:01On the first mountain of our life,
when we're shooting for our career, we shoot for happiness. And happiness is good,
it's the expansion of self. You win a victory, you get a promotion,
your team wins the Super Bowl, you're happy. Joy is not the expansion of self,
it's the dissolving of self. It's the moment when the skin barrier
disappears between a mother and her child, it's the moment when a naturalist
feels just free in nature. It's the moment where you're so lost
in your work or a cause, you have totally self-forgotten. And joy is a better thing
to aim for than happiness. 12:39I collect passages of joy,
of people when they lose it. One of my favorite is from Zadie Smith. In 1999, she was in a London nightclub, looking for her friends,
wondering where her handbag was. And suddenly, as she writes, ""... a rail-thin man with enormous eyes
reached across a sea of bodies for my hand. He kept asking me the same thing
over and over, 'Are you feeling it?' My ridiculous heels were killing me,
I was terrified that I might die, yet I felt simultaneously
overwhelmed with delight that 'Can I Kick It?'
should happen to be playing on this precise moment
in the history of the world on the sound system, and it was now morphing
into 'Teen Spirit.' I took the man's hand,
the top of my head blew away, we danced, we danced,
we gave ourselves up to joy."" 13:23And so what I'm trying to describe
is two different life mindsets. The first mountain mindset, which is about
individual happiness and career success. And it's a good mindset,
I have nothing against it. But we're in a national valley, because we don't have
the other mindset to balance it. We no longer feel good
about ourselves as a people, we've lost our defining
faith in our future, we don't see each other deeply,
we don't treat each other as well. And we need a lot of changes. We need an economic change
and environmental change. But we also need a cultural
and relational revolution. We need to name the language
of a recovered society. And to me, the weavers
have found that language. 14:05My theory of social change
is that society changes when a small group of people
find a better way to live, and the rest of us copy them. And these weavers have found
a better way to live. And you don't have to theorize about it. They are out there as community builders
all around the country. We just have to shift our lives a little, so we can say, ""I'm a weaver,
we're a weaver."" And if we do that, the hole inside ourselves gets filled, but more important,
the social unity gets repaired. 14:35Thank you very much. 14:36(Applause)"

", (699),"Transcript (1 Language)EnglishIvana Korom, TranslatorCamille Martínez, Reviewer00:00Adam Grant: Alright, Geoff,
start with your name and occupation. 00:03Geoff Nunberg: My name is Geoff Nunberg.
I'm a professor and a linguist. 00:07AG: How in the world does a linguist
end up writing a book about assholes? 00:11GN: Well, who better than a linguist? 00:15AG: Heads up: this episode
is going to use a lot of that word. 00:18GN: Linguist.
AG: No, not that one. 00:20GN: Bounder.
AG: No. 00:21GN: Cad.
AG: No. 00:23GN: Heel, phony.
AG: No and no. 00:25GN: Those words all articulated
a certain sense of the moral life. And ""asshole"" comes along
and kind of displaces them. 00:32AG: Today, we're talking about assholes. 00:35GN: Somebody who cheats on his wife but not necessarily
on his expense reports. The asshole is somebody whose efforts
to expand and swell his own sense of privilege is hurtful to others: the other employees,
whose work he takes credit for, the secretary who he has
picking up his laundry, whatever. 00:54(Music) 00:58AG: Look, I know it's not a polite word. But it's not going away. And neither are assholes. And the word itself evokes a feeling in us that something tamer
like ""jerk"" just doesn't. So we're going to use the word,
because that's what the pros do. 01:13Bob Sutton: I said, ""I want
to use the word 'asshole,' and you would never publish that
in 'Harvard Business Review.'"" She said, ""Try me."" 01:23(Theme music) 01:30AG: I'm Adam Grant, and this is WorkLife,
my podcast with TED. I'm an organizational psychologist. I study how to make
the people you work with not suck. In this show, I'm inviting myself inside the minds
of some truly unusual people, because they've mastered something
I wish everyone knew about work. Today: assholes, a field guide. Everyone's worked with at least one. How do you deal with them? And is it possible to create
an asshole-free office? 01:58(Music) 02:03Thanks to Bonobos
for sponsoring this episode. 02:06(Music) 02:17So, apparently there's a difference
between being an asshole, an asshat and an assclown. Yep, the Oxford English Dictionary
has recognized all three. But ""asshat"" and ""assclown""
don't have the same sting. They're mostly synonyms for ""obnoxious."" An asshole is someone who disrespects
and demeans other people and either denies it or just doesn't care. Think about the assholes
you've had to work with. How did they show it? Sometimes, it's passive-aggressive: stealing credit,
doling out blame unfairly, invading privacy, breaking promises. Other times, it's active-aggressive: badmouthing, screaming, ridiculing. 02:59Bob Sutton: My father used to say to me, ""When you grow up,
whatever you do, don't be an asshole and don't work with them
and don't work for them."" 03:09AG: Meet Bob Sutton. He's an organizational
psychologist at Stanford. He's become something of a connoisseur
of assholes at work. 03:17BS: An asshole is somebody
who leaves you feeling demeaned, de-energized and disrespected -- somebody who leaves you feeling like shit. 03:28AG: In 2007, he wrote
a whole book on assholes, and, well, he touched a nerve. 03:33BS: I got thousands of emails from people who felt
as if they were victims of assholes. 03:38AG: Turns out,
workplaces are full of them. And through his research, Bob has learned that it's pretty tough
to be an asshole to the people above you. Being an asshole has to do with
how you treat the people across from you and especially below you. 03:53BS: Abuse does seem to roll downhill. When I looked at my emails
and also the research, in about 80 percent of the cases, the person who was named
as the asshole in their life was their immediate boss. 04:06AG: The more Bob heard
from employees and leaders about the impact of this kind of behavior, the more he became convinced that it must have an actual,
measurable cost. 04:14BS: Just in the last decade, studying all forms
of abusive behavior in the workplace has become sort of a growth industry. And if you and I started
doing the list of all the costs that nasty people impose
on the people around them, both the fiscal and mental health costs, it's just stunning. 04:34AG: One notable experiment
was done with medical teams in Israel. Each team had a physician and two nurses
from the newborn intensive care unit, and they were brought in
to work with a visiting expert. Some teams were randomly assigned
to be berated by the expert. He told them he wasn't impressed
with the quality of medicine there, and they wouldn't last a week
in his department. After being insulted like this, the accuracy of the team's diagnoses
was almost 20 percent lower. And the procedures they did
were 15 percent less effective. I'm guessing you wouldn't want a 15-percent-less-effective
heart transplant. 05:09BS: I mean, this is one
of the biggest problems with treating people like dirt: they're less likely
to call out errors done by others. 05:16AG: To avoid mistakes,
people have to communicate, especially about things
that might go wrong. An asshole creates an environment of fear, where people stay silent
to avoid rocking the boat. And if getting demotivated
isn't bad enough, get this: working with an asshole
literally makes you dumber. 05:34BS: There's some evidence that after one has been
abused or disrespected, that one's cognitive ability
is temporarily affected. 05:41AG: One experiment
is especially revealing. Students showed up for a study, only to learn that they were
in the wrong room and had entered a professor's office. For some students, the professor
just directed them to the right room. The other half of the time,
the students got this: 05:56(Clip) (Door opening) 05:58Professor: Excuse me, can't you read? There's a sign on the door that tells you the experiment
will be in room 123, but you didn't even bother
to look at the door, did you? Instead you prefer to disturb me
and ask for directions, when you can clearly see that I'm busy. I'm not a secretary here,
I'm a busy professor. 06:17(Door slams) 06:18AG: What an asshole! The poor students who were randomly
assigned to that treatment were then asked to solve some anagrams. And they solved a quarter fewer
anagrams correctly. Then the students saw someone
drop a bunch of books. The ones who had just been verbally abused
were nine times less likely to help. Assholes undermine our ability
to think clearly and creatively. But what seems absolutely damning is that they also leave us with more
negative attitudes toward others. 06:46BS: Prolonged bullying
turns other people into assholes, so it's a contagious disease that spreads. 06:51AG: Of course, everyone has a limit. At some point, people just give up. They quit. Occasionally, they even get revenge. 06:59BS: There's research
from fast-food restaurants that when people have an abusive
supervisor running the restaurant that employees are more likely to steal. 07:07AG: (Laughs) Although,
if they're stealing fast food, they're only punishing themselves. 07:12BS: (Laughs) 07:13(Music) 07:17When I talk about the cost
of assholes at work, there are people who push back. They say, sometimes you just need
to be an asshole to be successful. And there's one example
that pops up every time. Let's call it ""the Steve Jobs question."" Recently, I had a chance
to sit down with someone uniquely qualified to weigh in on it. 07:37Walter Isaacson: Well,
he was a deeply spiritual, very intense person, who had rough edges
and was nasty at times and mean. 07:48AG: This is Walter Isaacson. He wrote the definitive
biography on Steve Jobs, spending countless hours with him and hundreds of people
who worked closely with him. 07:57WI: When I started
working on ""Steve Jobs,"" Woz -- Wozniak -- said to me, ""The main question you have to answer
is: Did he have to be so mean?"" 08:07AG: ""Ruthless,"" ""deceitful,"" ""cruel"" -- these are words that have often
been applied to Jobs, very frequently by his closest friends. Early on, Jobs screwed his cofounder
out of a big bonus and lied about it. He screamed and swore at colleagues,
belittled employees and harassed interviewees
by asking about their sex lives. This kind of behavior was what led Jobs
to get forced out of Apple -- his own company -- in the 80s. Take it from one
of his longtime collaborators, Apple engineer and designer, Jony Ive. He told Walter Isaacson
that when Jobs got frustrated, his way to achieve catharsis
was to hurt someone. According to Ive, Jobs felt he had a liberty
and a license to do that. 08:50WI: Working with him, you know, I was subject to watching him sort of, have that
very ""mercurial"" personality, as he put it. 09:02AG: I think we both know
a fair number of entrepreneurs who have held Jobs up as their role model and said, ""Look, he wasn't
the nicest guy in the world. And that's proof that this is
sometimes how you have to be."" Did he succeed in spite of
or because of his cruelty, in your view? 09:19WI: I guess my answer, in retrospect, is no, you don't have to be that mean. You don't have to be cruel to people. 09:26AG: There's a huge difference
between being demanding and being demeaning. Being demanding is having
extremely high standards and pretty low tolerance
for work that falls below them. Being demeaning is devaluing
other people as human beings, treating them with such disrespect
that they feel worthless. 09:45WI: When I asked Steve,
""Did you have to be so mean? Did you have to be so cruel to people?"" He said to me, ""You know,
when people do something that sucks, I just have to tell them it sucks, because I'm just a middle-class kid, trying to make sure I don't have
B players on my team. And so I can't afford
to be gentle and nice."" 10:07AG: Research suggests that leaders
who demean their employees have learned to rationalize aggression. They see that it sometimes
gets short-term results, while the long-term damage
is often invisible to them. So they justify it as necessary
to achieve their goals. Which means, if you think you have
to be an asshole to be successful, you might be an asshole. 10:28(Music) 10:33When you've had to deal
with an asshole at work, what have you done? If you don't have the power
to get rid of them, what should you do? Sometimes, you just have to learn
how to have a hard conversation. 10:43Sheila Heen: Yeah. 10:45AG: You're a lawyer
by training, aren't you? 10:47SH: (Laughs) Do you mean
am I an asshole by training? Yes, yes I am. (Laughs) 10:52AG: Sheila Heen is a recovering lawyer who teaches negotiation
at Harvard Law School. She cofounded a company
that specializes in conflict mediation and coauthored the book
""Difficult Conversations."" Basically, Sheila's job is teaching people
how to deal with an asshole -- and how to avoid acing like one. 11:09SH: Part of the job of lawyers in society
is to help people with conflicts. And the way that we / they
sometimes go about it often ends up escalating the conflict
rather than helping resolve it. And that's essentially the definition
of asshole-like behavior. 11:26AG: But sometimes the conflict happens
because one person is just an asshole. How often is that the case
in your experience as a mediator? 11:35SH: Well, it is true
100 percent of the time that each side would say
that the other side is being an asshole. 11:43(Laughter) 11:44We all hurt each other, upset each other, embarrass each other in front of other people, publicly -- just misstep and contribute to the other
person feeling really badly treated, sometimes in ways that we don't intend,
usually in ways that we don't intend, but occasionally in ways
that we do intend. 12:06AG: Sheila has three key recommendations
for having that conversation. The first is to give the other person
the benefit of the doubt. 12:13SH: People will say, ""You know,
you just have to assume good intentions."" And I think that often that's true. But I think assume good intentions
is just a little too strong. I think instead it should be:
assume you don't know. And that's the conversation
that we need to have, because I don't know what was up with you, but whatever it was, it's a problem. So let's figure that out
and see if we can fix it. 12:38AG: That's fantastic. Yeah, because that motivates me then
to go and find out whatever I'm missing. I'll go and try to learn: What were you thinking?
What was your intent? What was going on in that situation? That's really helpful. 12:50SH: I love the orientation
that that just created for you, which is that now you actually have
a little bit of curiosity. And so the conversation isn't about,
you know, letting her have it and straightening her out and letting her know
she shouldn't be an asshole next time. The conversation is about, ""Now I'm just curious
what was going on with you, because I was surprised by it, and we should address it so that we just won't have
this problem next time."" That's an orientation that is much more
likely to produce a better conversation and to solve the problem,
if it's solvable. 13:26(Music) 13:31AG: But Sheila, if you think
someone is just a total asshole, how should you deal with them? 13:37SH: The dilemma is that the worst
thing you can do, in many ways, is to do nothing over time. But the second worst thing that you can do is to fight back in the moment. They've been playing that game,
if they're a certified asshole, for a very long time, and so you are agreeing to basically
play the game on their turf. But as soon as you are able, whether that's an hour later
or the next morning, you come back to them
to have a conversation. 14:03AG: Sheila's second tip
for talking to office assholes is to make sure you don't put them
on the defensive. 14:09SH: What you're going to want
to say to them is something like, ""I don't know why you feel the need
to undermine me or demean me. I don't know why you feel the need
to humiliate everybody and control everything."" That's what you want to say to them. 14:23AG: Wait -- I'm not supposed to say that? 14:25SH: You can say it in your head. And you can say it in front of the mirror, if it will make you feel better. But what you're doing is, you're telling them something
about their intentions and their character, and you can bet that they're
going to argue with you about that. What they can't argue with
is about the impact that it's had on you. So, the most important thing
is to separate intentions and impact. 14:55AG: Sometimes assholes aren't aware
of the impact of their own behavior. 14:59SH: We know what we're trying to do
to get our point across. What we don't see and people
sometimes don't share with us is just how upsetting, demeaning,
unprofessional it was, and the ripple effect that it had
throughout the team and the organization. 15:15AG: Sheila's third suggestion
is to help them find a less demeaning way to accomplish their goals. I once worked with a colleague who was known to yell at people
occasionally in meetings. The first time I saw it happen, I called afterward to explain that I found
it disrespectful and unprofessional. My colleague said, ""Well, it was necessary
to get my point across."" And I realized this was someone
who had rationalized aggression. I wasn't sure what to do at that point. So I asked Sheila how we should think
about responding in a situation like that. 15:44SH: If you want to use
a little bit of humor in that moment, if you can think of it, when he says, ""Yeah, people feel that way, but that's the only way
for me to get my point across,"" you can say, ""Really? It was my impression that you were
smarter and more creative than that, so I bet you could come up
with ways to be just as clear, without having to actually
rip somebody else apart. But maybe I'm overestimating you,
maybe that's not true."" 16:09(Laughter) 16:12AG: Oh, I love that. So I could actually gently give them
a better way to accomplish their goals. 16:17SH: Yeah, it's a little ... The story in their head is,
the ends justify the means. Right? ""It was important for me
to get my point across, and if some people's feelings were hurt,
boo-hoo, that's not as important."" OK. I actually am going to challenge
whether that's true. 16:39AG: Sometimes, you can
use humor to challenge it without even saying a word. Back in the 1990s, the CEO of a tech company, Gordon Eubanks, was known for an unusual brand of insult. Gordon was working to grow Symantec
into a Fortune 500 company. And for some reason, he had a habit of comparing people
unfavorably to vegetables. 17:01Mark Bailey: ""That guy's dumber
than a head of lettuce."" 17:03(Laughter) 17:05AG: Mark Bailey was working
for Gordon at the time. Did he have other vegetable phrases? 17:10MB: Yeah, he would refer to
a zucchini as well, but the head of lettuce stuck. That was the one that I remember
him using pretty regularly. You knew exactly what he meant
when he said it. He did not think highly
of the person when he said that. 17:22AG: Was it always about a person,
sometimes about an idea? 17:28MB: It was usually about a person. 17:30AG: After everyone on Gordon's
team had been compared to a farmer's market's worth of produce, they finally decided to do something
about their boss's behavior. So Mark and his colleagues
went grocery shopping before their next staff meeting. 17:43MB: We arranged it so that we were all
gathering outside the conference room, and then Gordon shows up for the staff
meeting and kind of growls, ""How come everybody's
not in the room, yet? Are we going to get started?"" We all nod and then we let him
walk into the room first. 17:58AG: Gordon stepped inside and saw that every seat
at the conference table was occupied by a head of lettuce. Some of the lettuce heads had mustaches,
some were wearing sunglasses. What would you do if you were Gordon? When people get called on bad behavior, there's a real risk
that they'll get defensive and start calling people names
worse than vegetables. 18:18MB: And when he comes in and sees
all the heads of lettuce on the table, he just starts to laugh out loud. 18:24(Laughs) And we all got a big laugh out of it. 18:29AG: What was so clever
about the heads of lettuce prank is that it was nonthreatening. And Gordon realized
that Mark wasn't just playing a prank. He was also making a point. 18:37Gordon Eubanks: He thought it was funny
and probably would be helpful. It would unite a group of people. 18:44AG: And maybe most importantly, Gordon ended up
reflecting on his behavior. 18:47GE: Well, I'm sure people would think, yes, I was probably really an asshole. If you mean if someone can be very
difficult and unnecessarily abrasive, I'm sure there were times
when that happened. I've mellowed, of course, over the years. If someone steals your parking place, that's a different kind of an asshole than someone that's trying
to achieve something with a group of people. Demeaning, though, is wrong, and I'm sure there were times
I was demeaning. And that's a problem in an organization. 19:25(Music) 19:30AG: Yep, demeaning is a problem. What if you could
get rid of it altogether? Is it possible to create
a workplace with no assholes? 19:37(Music) 19:40More on that after the break. 19:43(Music) 19:50OK, this is going to be
a different kind of ad. I've played a personal role
in selecting the sponsors for this podcast, because they all have
interesting cultures of their own. Today, we're going
inside the workplace at Bonobos. 20:05(Music) 20:08D. Fooks remembers the first time Carla and her husband Aaron walked into
his Bonobos shop in Scottsdale. Carla was on a mission. 20:15DF: She was on the hunt
to really trim down his pants. 20:19AG: She had been in the store before and told D. she was trying
to change her husband's look. But he wasn't having it. If she ever got him in there, Carla said, she and D. had to team up
and seize the day. 20:31DF: Carla loved for Aaron to wear
some of the brighter, more fun prints. Aaron was a little more conservative and liked some of the more plain patterns. So there was that fun
little battle between them. 20:42AG: Carla won. And that first visit
was the beginning of a routine. Aaron and Carla would go golfing together, grab some lunch and then come into Bonobos and shop. 20:52DF: They'd always have
this playful back-and-forth, and there was always that fun exchange
of Carla pushing the boundary and Aaron realigning and resetting
where that line is drawn in the sand. 21:04AG: Everyone in the store
loved watching them together. They seemed like a real team. 21:09DF: You know, when you see a couple
who loves each other that much, it gives you hope in more ways than one. And I think they had an effect
on all of us in the shop. 21:20AG: There's evidence that customers
find ongoing service relationships more satisfying than one-off encounters
with a different provider each time. But building that relationship
isn't always easy. At Bonobos, the guides in their shops are encouraged to make
meaningful connections with customers, while of course respecting
their boundaries. As Aaron and Carla became regulars,
they developed a real bond with D. 21:40DF: It extended much more
than just a customer. They were kind of like family, in a way. 21:46AG: But sometimes,
even regulars take a break. Months went by where D.
didn't see Carla and Aaron. He didn't really think too much of it. Then, one day,
Aaron walked into the store. 21:56DF: He had come in and said,
""Hey, I haven't been in in a while. I kind of wanted to get resized
because I've lost some weight."" 22:03AG: D. went to pull up
Aaron's purchase history, which was under Carla's name. And he suddenly had a sinking feeling
about why Aaron was shopping alone. 22:11DF: It was almost like
a crazy, crazy feeling, just dawned on me. I feel like I intuitively just knew. And everything in me just kind of dropped. 22:25AG: Carla had passed away
a few months earlier of breast cancer. It had been quick -- only a month
after she was diagnosed with a recurrence. D. offered his condolences
and asked Aaron how he was holding up. 22:37DF: You know, he smiled, and it was one of those where you can tell
there was some pain behind it. But to feel his strength
and to feel his positive energy was indescribable. 22:50AG: Aaron was just there
for some everyday shopping. But he happened to mention that he had
a black-tie event later that week. He'd lost a lot of weight
so his tux didn't fit, and he was just going to rent one. After Aaron left the store,
D. leapt into action. He had noticed Aaron admiring
a particular tux -- the Capstone Italian Wool in navy. So he rush-ordered the tux
as a surprise gift to Aaron. It arrived on Aaron's
doorstep the next day, along with a letter
signed by everyone at the store. That afternoon, D.'s phone rang. 23:21DF: ""Hey, how's it going, Aaron?"" And his response was,
""What do you mean, how's it going? Man, I can't believe you guys did this."" He was just floored. It was one of the most
heartfelt thank-yous I can remember ever getting in my life. 23:37AG: It's what you do, D. says,
when you believe in the idea that customer relations
really are about just that -- a relationship. 23:45DF: We hope that you'll get, you know, at least put a smile on your face
for even that split second. So, it was just something that felt right. 23:56AG: Bonobos makes great clothes

when I hear stories like these. 24:24Cindy Hess: The partner was really upset
and took his briefcase, he was enraged and threw it
against the wall. Made a dent in the wall. 24:32(Clip) Woman: I had a manager who told
junior members of the firm, verbatim, ""You should spend your 20s sucking up
and doing your manager's work for them."" 24:41AG: My students have had
to work with some real jerks. 24:45(Clip) Man: My boss's boss once punched me
in the chest and publicly berated me for not wearing the correct hat outdoors. Asshole. 24:55AG: After decades
of working with companies and combing through the research, Stanford's Bob Sutton eventually concluded
that assholes make us all less productive. 25:04BS: Organizations that don't hire
people who treat others like dirt and who call out one another
when they act nasty, they're more effective places
and they're more humane places to work. 25:16AG: So Bob decided
to put a stake in the ground. As the expert in the field, he's called on organizations to set
a zero-tolerance policy for demeaning and disrespectful behavior. No bullying, no sabotage. A ""no asshole"" rule. 25:32Luis von Ahn: I love
this rule, I live by it. 25:34AG: This is Luis von Ahn. 25:35LvA: In general, in a company, it's better to have a hole
than an asshole. So it's better to not have -- if there's an asshole, it's really better
to just not have the person there. That basically means, don't hire assholes
or you should fire assholes. 25:48AG: Luis is the CEO and cofounder
of a company called Duolingo. It's an app that gamifies the process
of learning a new language. It has more than 300 million users, and it can teach you practically
every word you need to know in French, Korean, Navajo ... even Klingon. Well, almost every word. 26:08LvA: I'm not sure how to call
somebody an asshole in Spanish, even though it's my native language. 26:13AG: It's not ""pendejo""? 26:15LvA: So, ""pendejo"" is very Mexican. I'm from Guatemala. In Guatemala, we use ""cerote,""
but that's very regional slang. 26:24AG: What about French? 26:27LvA: I would not know
how to do this in French. I'm too remedial for that in French. 26:32AG: Well, I heard there's an app
that could fix that. 26:34(Laughter) 26:36LvA: In Duolingo, we do not
teach the word for asshole. 26:39AG: Duolingo is not just
a hugely popular app. It's a highly desirable place to work. In 2018, it was named one of the best
workplaces by ""Inc."" magazine and one of the top company cultures
by ""Entrepreneur"" magazine. When Luis and his cofounder
were launching the company, they were very conscious
about being anti-asshole. 26:58LvA: He said, ""I mainly just want to have
a place where I go to work every day, and I'm really happy to go to work. I just want to look forward
to go to work."" That made a lot of sense to me,
and that is what I strive for. 27:11AG: Luis is a computer scientist. Earlier in his career,
he invented reCAPTCHA. It's that little box on a website where you retype
the squiggly letters you see to prove you're a human and not a bot. The purpose was to protect
websites from abuse. Now at Duolingo, he's determined to build a culture
that protects employees from abuse. 27:30LvA: I have made this mistake
many times in my life, where there really is somebody
that's just like, brilliant. But really, they're an asshole. What I have found over time
is that generally you can find somebody equally as brilliant who's not an asshole. As I get older, I just have much less
tolerance for assholes than I used to. 27:49AG: So, Luis and his cofounder have tried
to keep assholes out of the front door through their interview process. Did you get it wrong early on, at all? 27:57LvA: Yeah. It is not the case that no asshole
has ever worked at Duolingo. 28:02AG: So how did the false positives
sneak in the door? 28:07LvA: Well, it's hard, particularly when you start hiring
more and more people. At first, you can hire people
who you either directly know or you know somebody that knows them. Eventually, you start hiring
randos off the internet that apply to work at your company. And it's much harder to know
whether they're an asshole or not. It is rare that anybody will tell you, ""Do not hire this person,
they're an asshole."" That is rare. That almost never happens. 28:32AG: When you're hiring, one of the weak links
in the asshole filter is referrals. Job applicants get to pick
their best references, people who have seen them
in a positive light, people who want to help them, or in the worst case, get rid of them,
by foisting them on someone else. But when talking to references, you can learn to ask
the right kinds of questions and spot the nuances in the answers. 28:54LvA: A really great question is,
""Do they work well with others?"" Nobody tells you, ""No,
they don't work well with others."" That's rare. The answer you want is, ""Oh, my God, yes,
they're great at working with others."" That's the answer you want. The one you don't want is, ""Yeah, um ... for most people, they are."" Like, that -- that means, ""Nah, they're actually not good
at working with others, and they've had trouble."" 29:18AG: I've found that you can get
references to be more honest by forcing them to choose
between two negative qualities. What's more likely: that this applicant
will be a total pushover or maybe a little manipulative? 29:30LvA: Hiring mistakes, where you hire a person
that you shouldn't have hired, are significantly more costly
than the other way around, which is, you didn't hire somebody
you should have hired. Those are mistakes, too,
but they're not very costly. 29:45(Music) 29:48AG: Here's a question:
in your team, what's more productive: replacing an average performer with a star or replacing a toxic worker
with an average one? One study looked at
the performance and turnover of more than 50,000 employees. It turned out that just replacing
a toxic worker with an average one can be twice as profitable
as upgrading an average one to a star. 30:12LvA: I don't think I've ever come across
somebody that is so brilliant, so irreplaceable, that it can justify them being assholes. 30:21AG: So you wouldn't hire a Steve Jobs? 30:24LvA: Well, I think Steve Jobs
was an amazing founder, I don't know how good
as an employee he would be. My guess is, he'd probably be
a shitty employee. 30:33AG: Who knows whether Jobs
would have been a good employee. But one thing seems clear: he probably would have been a vocal one. And giving employees a voice might be just the thing
that workplaces need to truly lock out assholes. 30:48CH: It really gives them a chance
to feel empowered and to be empowered. 30:52AG: This is Cindy Hess. She's a partner at a law firm. And one day, she got
some unexpected feedback. 30:58CH: OK, so the envelope comes,
it's a sealed envelope, you open it up, there were
boxes to check that said, ""Would you want to work
with this person again?"" And I think one person at least said, no, they wouldn't want
to work with me again. And my heart sunk when I saw that. ""Oh, gosh, what have I done
to make that person feel that way?"" 31:21AG: The anonymous person
who filled out this form was a junior associate
who reported to Cindy and apparently thought she was selfish. 31:28CH: I was nice when I needed to be nice, took interest in somebody
when that would serve my needs, but maybe that was transparent, that I wasn't being genuine
in that interest. 31:44AG: So I have to ask you, then: Do you think that in the past,
before you got this feedback, you were kind of an asshole? 31:51CH: (Laughs) Well ... I guess I would say that sometimes I didn't act in the best way. 32:05AG: So do you think other people
called you an asshole? 32:07CH: Maybe. I hope not. 32:09(Laughter) 32:11AG: So I will say,
by my definition at least, I think you are not an asshole. 32:15CH: Thank you. You know, I think my reviews
have gone way up, because I really realized
that the behavior I was exhibiting wasn't always the best behavior. And so I changed it. 32:30AG: Unfortunately, many people
aren't as open to feedback and course correction as Cindy. If you want to stop
the assholes in your office, you have to address the thing
that lets them get away with it -- the reward system. It's a mistake to just incentivize
individual achievement. You have to reward and promote people
who elevate others, rather than undermining them. which means paying special attention to how those in power
treat those who lack it. To prevent bosses
from acting like assholes, you have to give subordinates power. When I gave a talk
at Cindy's law firm, Fenwick &amp; West, I discovered that they have
some unique tools for doing this. They actually let junior associates
pick which senior partners they work with. 33:12CH: It's truly a free market. When you're a partner and you have
a new client coming in the door and you need to staff it
with an associate or two, you have to go and ask people, and it's across the entire
corporate group. For example, I'm a corporate partner, so I would go and ask various associates
to work with me on that client. And they have the unfettered
ability to say no. 33:35AG: Which means that
when a partner is a ""bosshole,"" word spreads fast. 33:40CH: Associates are going to choose
to work with the people that they enjoy working with,
who they're going to learn from, who are going to mentor them, who are going to take
an interest in their career. And those people
who don't act in that way, those partners who don't act in that way, are going to have a really difficult time
getting their matters staffed. 33:59AG: So that means, if there's a partner
I think is an asshole, I can just choose not to work
with that person? 34:04CH: That's exactly right. 34:06AG: That's amazing. How do I get that job? 34:08CH: Yeah, and we've had situations with partners with a significant
amount of business saying, ""I want to have a designated
group of associates to work with me."" And the firm said, ""No.
We're not going to do that. We're not going to modify
our free-market approach because you're having a more
difficult time getting your work staffed."" 34:28AG: To make sure leaders know
how they're being viewed, they do anonymous upward reviews, where junior associates
rate senior partners -- which doesn't happen in many law firms. 34:37CH: When I was interviewing
with law firms, I could tell when a law firm
was really catering to a star. I remember being a first-year associate
and I would see big corner offices with vestibules to get into that office, like of the secretary. You could tell that those
were the sorts of places where they were really catering
to particular partners who had a lot of power. 35:05AG: Assholes thrive
in certain kinds of workplaces -- places where leaders say
they want teamwork, but only pay and promote
on individual results. The classic term for it is ""the folly
of rewarding A, while hoping for B."" For one example, look at a company
that was huge in the 90s. 35:21(Clip) Man: It starts with good people. 35:23AG: Its stated core values
were communication, respect, integrity and excellence. 35:29(Clip) Man: There probably are times
that there's a desire to cut corners, but we can't have that at Enron. 35:37AG: Enron may have claimed
to value good behavior, but they actually rewarded
ruthlessness and selfishness. 35:43BS: One of my favorite
diagnostic questions that I like to ask in organizations is, ""Who is a superstar here?"" 35:50AG: Psychologist Bob Sutton again. 35:52BS: And if the superstars are
pretty consistently people who are jerks, people who are takers, that's a sign to me that the game is
that those people are getting rewarded, despite the rhetoric. It means that they're forgiven, and to me, that's the real test. 36:08AG: Most important question. 36:10BS: Yes, sir. 36:11AG: Do you believe that there is
such a thing as an asshole-free workplace? 36:15BS: No. 36:17AG: Damn it! (BS laughs) Damn it. You asshole! (BS laughs) 36:21BS: I think -- 36:23AG: I was really hoping
you would tell me there's one. 36:25BS: I think there are workplaces where there's very few
or maybe no certified assholes, but there's always going to be
some temporary jerk behavior, just because we both know
it's so easy for us to accidentally leave people
feeling disrespected. We're going to be tired,
we're going to be grouchy, in a hurry, somebody's going to yell at us --
it's going to happen. But the difference is, what happens when there's a transgression? 36:52AG: When the belief that it's necessary
to be an asshole doesn't get challenged, behavior often becomes normalized, not only by the perpetrators,
but also by victims and witnesses. Here's conflict mediator,
Sheila Heen, again. 37:05SH: The people who say it's actually
a big plus to have an asshole in your organization, the people who would say
the no-asshole rule produces cultures that are very polite but are not
as dedicated to excellence or quality, part of what they're
identifying is this tension, which is that in polite cultures, if our main goal is not
to hurt anybody's feelings, well, then we don't actually
give each other feedback or point out, ""Actually we could
be doing this a lot better."" And so things get driven underground, and it takes an asshole
to come along and say, ""What are we thinking? This is stupid."" Right? 37:47AG: Do you think that workplaces
should have no-asshole rules? 37:53SH: Do I think workplaces
should have no-asshole rules? Yes. If the implicit rule
behind the no-asshole rule is, ""nobody should ever feel upset,"" that's not really a workable rule. I think, in workplaces, the rule should be
that how you treat people matters. A lot. And it doesn't mean that we won't
sometimes have hard conversations. 38:18AG: I think every leader
has a responsibility to strive for a no-asshole culture. It's the smart thing to do
if you want to attract, motivate and retain talented people. But more importantly,
it's the right thing to do. We spend so many hours at work, and we have a right to be treated
with dignity during those hours. So, screen assholes
out of your hiring process. Make sure you don't reward
people who get individual results at the expense of others and create a toxic culture. And when someone is demeaning, see if you can find a respectful way
to let them know what impact they've had. If you don't have the power
to remove or reform an asshole, your best bet is to minimize
your interaction. And if that isn't an option, you can at least control
how you view that person. Bob Sutton has a colleague
who has some fun with it. 39:05BS: He pretends that he's
sort of an asshole specialist, and he just considers himself really lucky
to see this spectacular, amazing specimen. 39:16(Theme music) 39:23AG: WorkLife is hosted by me, Adam Grant. The show is produced by TED

feats of memory. And this is verified not just

1,The secret to great opportunities? The person you haven't met yet,Tanya Menon,Feb 2018,"We often find ourselves stuck in narrow social circles with similar people. What habits confine us, and how can we break them? Organizational psychologist Tanya Menon considers how we can be more intentional about expanding our social universes -- and how it can lead to new ideas and opportunities.", (70K),"Transcript (24 Languages)EnglishEspañolFrançaisItalianoMagyarNederlandsPolskiPortuguês brasileiroPortuguês de PortugalSvenskaTürkçeΕλληνικάРусскийСрпски, SrpskiУкраїнськаئۇيغۇرچەالعربيةفارسىکورمانجیภาษาไทย中文 (简体)中文 (繁體)日本語한국어FootnotesFootnotes00:00I started teaching MBA students 17 years ago. Sometimes I run into
my students years later. And when I run into them,
a funny thing happens. I don't remember just their faces; I also remember where exactly
in the classroom they were sitting. And I remember who
they were sitting with as well. This is not because I have
any special superpowers of memory. The reason I can remember them is because they are creatures of habit. They are sitting with their
favorite people in their favorite seats. They find their twins,
they stay with them for the whole year. 00:39Now, the danger of this
for my students is they're at risk of leaving the university
with just a few people who are exactly like them. They're going to squander their chance
for an international, diverse network. How could this happen to them? My students are open-minded. They come to business school precisely
so that they can get great networks. 01:02Now, all of us socially narrow
in our lives, in our school, in work, and so I want you to think about this one. How many of you here
brought a friend along for this talk? I want you to look
at your friend a little bit. Are they of the same nationality as you? Are they of the same gender as you? Are they of the same race? Really look at them closely. Don't they kind of look like you as well? 01:31(Laughter) 01:32The muscle people are together, and the people with the same hairstyles and the checked shirts. 01:38We all do this in life. We all do it in life, and in fact,
there's nothing wrong with this. It makes us comfortable to be
around people who are similar. The problem is when
we're on a precipice, right? When we're in trouble,
when we need new ideas, when we need new jobs,
when we need new resources -- this is when we really pay a price
for living in a clique. 02:01Mark Granovetter, the sociologist,
had a famous paper ""The Strength of Weak Ties,"" and what he did in this paper
is he asked people how they got their jobs. And what he learned was that
most people don't get their jobs through their strong ties -- their father,
their mother, their significant other. They instead get jobs through weak ties,
people who they just met. So if you think about what
the problem is with your strong ties, think about your
significant other, for example. The network is redundant. Everybody that they know, you know. Or I hope you know them. Right? Your weak ties --
people you just met today -- they are your ticket
to a whole new social world. 02:43The thing is that we have this amazing
ticket to travel our social worlds, but we don't use it very well. Sometimes we stay awfully close to home. And today, what I want to talk about is: What are those habits that keep
human beings so close to home, and how can we be
a little bit more intentional about traveling our social universe? 03:03footnotefootnoteSo let's look at the first strategy. The first strategy is to use
a more imperfect social search engine. What I mean by a social search engine is how you are finding
and filtering your friends. And so people always tell me, ""I want to get lucky through the network. I want to get a new job.
I want to get a great opportunity."" And I say, ""Well, that's really hard, because your networks
are so fundamentally predictable."" Map out your habitual daily footpath, and what you'll probably discover
is that you start at home, you go to your school or your workplace, you maybe go up
the same staircase or elevator, you go to the bathroom --
the same bathroom -- and the same stall in that bathroom, you end up in the gym, then you come right back home. It's like stops on a train schedule. It's that predictable. It's efficient, but the problem is,
you're seeing exactly the same people. Make your network
slightly more inefficient. Go to a bathroom on a different floor. You encounter a whole new
network of people. 04:09The other side of it is how
we are actually filtering. And we do this automatically. The minute we meet someone,
we are looking at them, we meet them, we are initially seeing, ""You're interesting."" ""You're not interesting.""
""You're relevant."" We do this automatically.
We can't even help it. And what I want to encourage you
to do instead is to fight your filters. I want you to take a look
around this room, and I want you to identify
the least interesting person that you see, and I want you to connect with them
over the next coffee break. And I want you to go
even further than that. What I want you to do is find
the most irritating person you see as well and connect with them. 04:49footnotefootnoteWhat you are doing with this exercise
is you are forcing yourself to see what you don't want to see, to connect with who
you don't want to connect with, to widen your social world. To truly widen, what we have to do is, we've got to fight our sense of choice. We've got to fight our choices. And my students hate this,
but you know what I do? I won't let them sit
in their favorite seats. I move them around from seat to seat. I force them to work with different people so there are more accidental
bumps in the network where people get a chance
to connect with each other. And we studied exactly this kind
of an intervention at Harvard University. At Harvard, when you look at
the rooming groups, there's freshman rooming groups,
people are not choosing those roommates. They're of all different races,
all different ethnicities. Maybe people are initially uncomfortable
with those roommates, but the amazing thing is, at the end of a year with those students, they're able to overcome
that initial discomfort. They're able to find deep-level
commonalities with people. 05:52footnotefootnoteSo the takeaway here is not just
""take someone out to coffee."" It's a little more subtle. It's ""go to the coffee room."" When researchers talk about social hubs, what makes a social hub so special
is you can't choose; you can't predict who
you're going to meet in that place. And so with these social hubs,
the paradox is, interestingly enough, to get randomness, it requires, actually, some planning. In one university that I worked at, there was a mail room
on every single floor. What that meant is that the only people
who would bump into each other are those who are actually on that floor and who are bumping
into each other anyway. At another university I worked at,
there was only one mail room, so all the faculty
from all over that building would run into each other
in that social hub. A simple change in planning, a huge difference in the traffic of people and the accidental bumps in the network. 06:52Here's my question for you: What are you doing that breaks you
from your social habits? Where do you find yourself in places where you get injections
of unpredictable diversity? And my students give me
some wonderful examples. They tell me when they're doing
pickup basketball games, or my favorite example
is when they go to a dog park. They tell me it's even better
than online dating when they're there. 07:17So the real thing that
I want you to think about is we've got to fight our filters. We've got to make ourselves
a little more inefficient, and by doing so, we are creating
a more imprecise social search engine. And you're creating that randomness, that luck that is going to cause you
to widen your travels, through your social universe. 07:38But in fact, there's more to it than that. Sometimes we actually buy ourselves
a second-class ticket to travel our social universe. We are not courageous
when we reach out to people. Let me give you an example of that. A few years ago, I had
a very eventful year. That year, I managed to lose a job, I managed to get a dream job
overseas and accept it, I had a baby the next month, I got very sick, I was unable to take the dream job. And so in a few weeks,
what ended up happening was, I lost my identity as a faculty member, and I got a very stressful
new identity as a mother. What I also got was tons
of advice from people. And the advice I despised
more than any other advice was, ""You've got to go network with everybody."" When your psychological world
is breaking down, the hardest thing to do
is to try and reach out and build up your social world. 08:34footnotefootnoteAnd so we studied exactly this idea
on a much larger scale. What we did was we looked at high
and low socioeconomic status people, and we looked at them in two situations. We looked at them first
in a baseline condition, when they were quite comfortable. And what we found was that
our lower socioeconomic status people, when they were comfortable,
were actually reaching out to more people. They thought of more people. They were also less constrained
in how they were networking. They were thinking of more diverse people than the higher-status people. Then we asked them
to think about maybe losing a job. We threatened them. And once they thought about that, the networks they generated
completely differed. The lower socioeconomic status
people reached inwards. They thought of fewer people. They thought of less-diverse people. The higher socioeconomic status
people thought of more people, they thought of a broader network, they were positioning themselves
to bounce back from that setback. 09:34Let's consider what this actually means. Imagine that you were being
spontaneously unfriended by everyone in your network other than your mom,
your dad and your dog. 09:48(Laughter) 09:49This is essentially what we are doing at these moments when
we need our networks the most. Imagine -- this is what we're doing.
We're doing it to ourselves. We are mentally compressing our networks when we are being harassed,
when we are being bullied, when we are threatened about losing a job, when we feel down and weak. We are closing ourselves off,
isolating ourselves, creating a blind spot where we actually
don't see our resources. We don't see our allies,
we don't see our opportunities. 10:18footnotefootnoteHow can we overcome this? Two simple strategies. One strategy is simply to look
at your list of Facebook friends and LinkedIn friends just so you remind yourself
of people who are there beyond those that
automatically come to mind. And in our own research,
one of the things we did was, we considered Claude Steele's
research on self-affirmation: simply thinking about your own values, networking from a place of strength. What Leigh Thompson, Hoon-Seok Choi
and I were able to do is, we found that people
who had affirmed themselves first were able to take advice from people who would otherwise
be threatening to them. 10:54footnotefootnoteHere's a last exercise. I want you to look in your email in-box, and I want you to look at the last time
you asked somebody for a favor. And I want you to look
at the language that you used. Did you say things like, ""Oh, you're a great resource,"" or ""I owe you one,"" ""I'm obligated to you."" All of this language
represents a metaphor. It's a metaphor of economics, of a balance sheet, of accounting, of transactions. And when we think about human relations
in a transactional way, it is fundamentally uncomfortable
to us as human beings. We must think about human relations
and reaching out to people in more humane ways. 11:35Here's an idea as to how to do so. Look at words like ""please,"" ""thank you,""
""you're welcome"" in other languages. Look at the literal
translation of these words. Each of these words is a word
that helps us impose upon other people in our social networks. And so, the word ""thank you,"" if you look at it in Spanish,
Italian, French, ""gracias,"" ""grazie,"" ""merci"" in French. Each of them are ""grace"" and ""mercy."" They are godly words. There's nothing economic
or transactional about those words. The word ""you're welcome"" is interesting. The great persuasion theorist
Robert Cialdini says we've got to get our favors back. So we need to emphasize
the transaction a little bit more. He says, ""Let's not say 'You're welcome.' Instead say, 'I know you'd
do the same for me.'"" But sometimes it may be helpful
to not think in transactional ways, to eliminate the transaction,
to make it a little bit more invisible. And in fact, if you look in Chinese, the word ""bú kè qì"" in Chinese,
""You're welcome,"" means, ""Don't be formal; we're family. We don't
need to go through those formalities."" And ""kembali"" in Indonesian
is ""Come back to me."" When you say ""You're welcome"" next time, think about how you can maybe
eliminate the transaction and instead strengthen that social tie. Maybe ""It's great to collaborate,""
or ""That's what friends are for."" 12:54footnotefootnoteI want you to think about how
you think about this ticket that you have to travel your social universe. Here's one metaphor. It's a common metaphor:
""Life is a journey."" Right? It's a train ride, and you're a passenger on the train, and there are certain people with you. Certain people get on this train, and some stay with you,
some leave at different stops, new ones may enter. I love this metaphor,
it's a beautiful one. But I want you to consider
a different metaphor. This one is passive,
being a passenger on that train, and it's quite linear. You're off to some particular destination. Why not instead think of yourself as an atom, bumping up against other atoms, maybe transferring energy with them, bonding with them a little and maybe creating something new on your travels
through the social universe. 13:44Thank you so much. And I hope we bump into each other again. 13:47(Applause)"
1,What makes a friendship last?,Mona Chalabi,Oct 2021,"Sustaining friendships -- and making new friends -- can be challenging, even when we know it's important.

And each time that I move to a new
neighborhood, a new city, a new country, it seems to get harder and harder
to sustain the friendships I left behind. But right now, sustaining those friendships
seems especially important and especially difficult. So I'm wondering what is manageable? How can I keep those friendships afloat
without getting overwhelmed? 00:22[Am I Normal? with Mona Chalabi] 00:25To find out, I turned
to my two most trusted sources: data and my mum. Now, since she hates being on camera, this puppet is going to be
as good as it gets. But before she weighs in, I wanted to look at the studies
on how friendships fall apart in the hopes that I might be able
to avoid some of those pitfalls. 00:42According to one study, friendships often dissolve
because of a lack of opportunity to meet, hang out and connect. Which may explain why,
after a year of isolation, some of my friendships feel
like they're hanging on by a thread. The same researcher made headlines with the finding that we lose half
of our friendships every seven years. 01:00Now, before you start doomscrolling
through your contact list, you should know that's not quite
as severe as it sounds. Over those seven years, the size of our friendship group
actually stays pretty stable. So if you have 20 or 30 good friends now, seven years later, you still probably have
20 or 30 good friends. The catch, though, is that 52 percent
of those faces will be different. Over seven years, we will replace many of the people
in our network with new ones. 01:25As someone who has had to work
more and more from home, the opportunity to go out
and make new friends is pretty limited. It's a luxury I don't often have. And the research
on the formation of new friends suggest that this takes time. A lot of time. 01:38A recent study found that you have to spend between
40 and 60 hours with someone before they can go from
an acquaintance to a casual friend. They get upgraded
to a fully fledged friend around 80 to 100 hours, and get elevated to a best friend after you spend at least 200 hours
of quality time together. 01:58And the emphasis here is on quality time. You might say ""hi""
to a barista every morning or be polite to a coworker, but you wouldn't necessarily invite
either one over for dinner. 02:08I was feeling a little bit daunted
by all of these numbers until I spoke to my mum, who has a more optimistic
take on all of this. ""A friendship is essential in your life. How does friendship start? The first thing is to know that person. If you don't want to know these people, if you don't open a window
of communication, you will never become friends of them. You have to start. If you want to be isolated, you just shut your windows
and look at them, and they don't look at you."" 02:38OK, so yes, if I really, really
want to make a new friendship, I could go out and make the effort
to make a new friend by, say, knocking on my neighbor's door, who plays really good music
a bit too loudly. But what about my current
group of friends? Are we all doomed just
because we don't get the chance to hang out like we used to? 02:56""I think yes, with the friends, the distance gets further and further
if you are not meeting them. But it also shows you the ones that don't disappear
because of the time or the distance. They will be there for you
if you need them. So the special friends. And this difficult time
shows you who cares and who is a good person
or a good friend."" 03:24I think she's right. I don't think there's a magical formula or a mythical number of hours to chase. This just takes time and effort. So if you'll excuse me, I have a good friend that I need to call."
1,What makes life worth living in the face of death,Lucy Kalanithi,May 2017,"In this deeply moving talk, Lucy Kalanithi reflects on life and purpose, sharing the story of her late husband, Paul, a young neurosurgeon who turned to writing after his terminal cancer diagnosis. ""Engaging in the full range of experience -- living and dying, love and loss -- is what we get to do,"" Kalanithi says. ""Being human doesn't happen despite suffering -- it happens within it.""", (75K),"Transcript (22 Languages)Bahasa IndonesiaEnglishEspañolFrançaisMagyarNederlandsPortuguês brasileiroPortuguês de PortugalRomânăTiếng ViệtTürkçeΕλληνικάРусскийУкраїнськаעבריתالعربيةفارسىภาษาไทย中文 (简体)中文 (繁體)日本語한국어00:00A few days after my husband Paul
was diagnosed with stage IV lung cancer, we were lying in our bed at home, and Paul said, ""It's going to be OK."" And I remember answering back, ""Yes. We just don't know what OK means yet."" 00:23Paul and I had met as first-year
medical students at Yale. He was smart and kind and super funny. He used to keep a gorilla suit
in the trunk of his car, and he'd say, ""It's for emergencies only."" 00:37(Laughter) 00:39I fell in love with Paul as I watched
the care he took with his patients. He stayed late talking with them, seeking to understand
the experience of illness and not just its technicalities. He later told me he fell in love with me when he saw me cry over an EKG
of a heart that had ceased beating. We didn't know it yet, but even in the heady days of young love, we were learning how
to approach suffering together. 01:10We got married and became doctors. I was working as an internist and Paul was finishing his training
as a neurosurgeon when he started to lose weight. He developed excruciating back pain
and a cough that wouldn't go away. And when he was admitted to the hospital, a CT scan revealed tumors
in Paul's lungs and in his bones. We had both cared for patients
with devastating diagnoses; now it was our turn. 01:46We lived with Paul's illness
for 22 months. He wrote a memoir about facing mortality. I gave birth to our daughter Cady, and we loved her and each other. We learned directly how to struggle
through really tough medical decisions. The day we took Paul
into the hospital for the last time was the most difficult day of my life. When he turned to me at the end and said, ""I'm ready,"" I knew that wasn't just a brave decision. It was the right one. Paul didn't want a ventilator and CPR. In that moment, the most important thing to Paul was to hold our baby daughter. Nine hours later, Paul died. 02:43I've always thought of myself
as a caregiver -- most physicians do -- and taking care of Paul
deepened what that meant. Watching him reshape
his identity during his illness, learning to witness and accept his pain, talking together through his choices -- those experiences taught me that resilience does not mean
bouncing back to where you were before, or pretending that
the hard stuff isn't hard. It is so hard. It's painful, messy stuff. But it's the stuff. And I learned that when we
approach it together, we get to decide what success looks like. 03:31One of the first things
Paul said to me after his diagnosis was, ""I want you to get remarried."" And I was like, whoa, I guess
we get to say anything out loud. 03:41(Laughter) 03:44It was so shocking and heartbreaking ... and generous, and really comforting because it was so starkly honest, and that honesty turned out
to be exactly what we needed. Early in Paul's illness, we agreed we would
just keep saying things out loud. Tasks like making a will, or completing our advance directives -- tasks that I had always avoided -- were not as daunting as they once seemed. I realized that completing
an advance directive is an act of love -- like a wedding vow. A pact to take care of someone, codifying the promise that til death do us part, I will be there. If needed, I will speak for you. I will honor your wishes. That paperwork became
a tangible part of our love story. 04:47As physicians, Paul and I were in a good position to understand and even
accept his diagnosis. We weren't angry about it, luckily, because we'd seen so many patients
in devastating situations, and we knew that death is a part of life. But it's one thing to know that; it was a very different experience to actually live with the sadness
and uncertainty of a serious illness. Huge strides are being made
against lung cancer, but we knew that Paul likely had
months to a few years left to live. 05:24During that time, Paul wrote about his transition
from doctor to patient. He talked about feeling
like he was suddenly at a crossroads, and how he would have thought
he'd be able to see the path, that because he treated so many patients, maybe he could follow in their footsteps. But he was totally disoriented. Rather than a path, Paul wrote, ""I saw instead only a harsh, vacant,
gleaming white desert. As if a sandstorm
had erased all familiarity. I had to face my mortality and try to understand
what made my life worth living, and I needed my oncologist's
help to do so."" 06:15The clinicians taking care of Paul gave me an even deeper appreciation
for my colleagues in health care. We have a tough job. We're responsible for helping patients
have clarity around their prognoses and their treatment options, and that's never easy,
but it's especially tough when you're dealing with potentially
terminal illnesses like cancer. Some people don't want to know
how long they have left, others do. Either way, we never have those answers. Sometimes we substitute hope by emphasizing the best-case scenario. In a survey of physicians, 55 percent said
they painted a rosier picture than their honest opinion when describing a patient's prognosis. It's an instinct born out of kindness. But researchers have found that when people better understand
the possible outcomes of an illness, they have less anxiety, greater ability to plan and less trauma for their families. 07:28Families can struggle
with those conversations, but for us, we also found that information
immensely helpful with big decisions. Most notably, whether to have a baby. Months to a few years meant
Paul was not likely to see her grow up. But he had a good chance
of being there for her birth and for the beginning of her life. I remember asking Paul if he thought having
to say goodbye to a child would make dying even more painful. And his answer astounded me. He said, ""Wouldn't it be great if it did?"" And we did it. Not in order to spite cancer, but because we were learning that living fully
means accepting suffering. 08:31Paul's oncologist tailored his chemo so he could continue
working as a neurosurgeon, which initially we thought
was totally impossible. When the cancer advanced and Paul shifted from surgery to writing, his palliative care doctor
prescribed a stimulant medication so he could be more focused. They asked Paul about
his priorities and his worries. They asked him what trade-offs
he was willing to make. Those conversations
are the best way to ensure that your health care matches your values. Paul joked that it's not
like that ""birds and bees"" talk you have with your parents, where you all get it over with
as quickly as possible, and then pretend it never happened. You revisit the conversation
as things change. You keep saying things out loud. I'm forever grateful because Paul's clinicians felt that their job wasn't to try
to give us answers they didn't have, or only to try to fix things for us, but to counsel Paul
through painful choices ... when his body was failing
but his will to live wasn't. 09:49Later, after Paul died, I received a dozen bouquets of flowers, but I sent just one ... to Paul's oncologist, because she supported his goals and she helped him weigh his choices. She knew that living
means more than just staying alive. 10:13A few weeks ago,
a patient came into my clinic. A woman dealing
with a serious chronic disease. And while we were talking
about her life and her health care, she said, ""I love my palliative care team. They taught me that it's OK to say 'no'."" Yeah, I thought, of course it is. But many patients don't feel that. Compassion and Choices did a study where they asked people
about their health care preferences. And a lot of people
started their answers with the words ""Well, if I had a choice ..."" If I had a choice. And when I read that ""if,"" I understood better why one in four people receives excessive or unwanted
medical treatment, or watches a family member receive
excessive or unwanted medical treatment. It's not because doctors don't get it. We do. We understand the real
psychological consequences on patients and their families. The things is, we deal with them, too. Half of critical care nurses
and a quarter of ICU doctors have considered quitting their jobs because of distress over feeling
that for some of their patients, they've provided care
that didn't fit with the person's values. But doctors can't make sure
your wishes are respected until they know what they are. 11:52Would you want to be on life support
if it offered any chance of longer life? Are you most worried
about the quality of that time, rather than quantity? Both of those choices
are thoughtful and brave, but for all of us, it's our choice. That's true at the end of life and for medical care throughout our lives. If you're pregnant,
do you want genetic screening? Is a knee replacement right or not? Do you want to do dialysis
in a clinic or at home? The answer is: it depends. What medical care will help you
live the way you want to? I hope you remember that question the next time you face
a decision in your health care. Remember that you always have a choice, and it is OK to say no to a treatment
that's not right for you. 12:54There's a poem by W.S. Merwin -- it's just two sentences long -- that captures how I feel now. ""Your absence has gone through me like thread through a needle. Everything I do
is stitched with its color."" For me that poem evokes my love for Paul, and a new fortitude that came from loving and losing him. 13:28When Paul said, ""It's going to be OK,"" that didn't mean
that we could cure his illness. Instead, we learned to accept
both joy and sadness at the same time; to uncover beauty and purpose both despite and because we are all born and we all die. And for all the sadness
and sleepless nights, it turns out there is joy. I leave flowers on Paul's grave and watch our two-year-old
run around on the grass. I build bonfires on the beach
and watch the sunset with our friends. Exercise and mindfulness
meditation have helped a lot. And someday, I hope I do get remarried. 14:24Most importantly,
I get to watch our daughter grow. I've thought a lot
about what I'm going to say to her when she's older. ""Cady, engaging in the full
range of experience -- living and dying, love and loss -- is what we get to do. Being human doesn't happen
despite suffering. It happens within it. When we approach suffering together, when we choose not to hide from it, our lives don't diminish, they expand."" 15:09I've learned that cancer
isn't always a battle. Or if it is, maybe it's a fight for something
different than we thought. Our job isn't to fight fate, but to help each other through. Not as soldiers but as shepherds. That's how we make it OK, even when it's not. By saying it out loud, by helping each other through ... and a gorilla suit never hurts, either. 15:48Thank you. 15:49(Applause)"

like social failures. What’s worse: our laws treat unmarried people
as lesser citizens. Marriage comes with over 1,000 rights
and benefits under federal law. These include the ability
to get your spouse citizenship, share health insurance,
get better tax rates and inherit tax-free at death and more. Part of the winning argument
for same-sex marriage was that we shouldn't deprive gay couples
of all of these essential benefits. But I ask you, why should anyone be denied benefits
because they're in a romantic relationship of which some people disapprove? Or because they're single. 02:00(Applause) 02:01Thank you. 02:03Or because they're basing family on something other
than a romantic relationship, like co-parenting a child. Our laws should move away from the idea
that there's one ideal family form and value all families as they exist. 02:18(Applause) 02:22That's what I've dedicated my career to, and today, I'll share some of my visions for how we can change US laws
to benefit all families, but also how an expansive view of family will strengthen all
of your own relationships. 02:36For nearly 15 years with my law firm
for LGBTQ and non-nuclear families, I've supported same sex couples. But also the many family
forms beyond marriage, like platonic partners
who are raising a child together or sharing finances
without a romantic relationship. Or grandparents who are raising
their grandchildren. Or a lesbian couple
co-parenting with a male friend. Or polyamorous partners who might be in a committed
relationship of three or four. Within that legal advocacy, I facilitate discussions to make sure
that everyone's intentions are aligned and then help them design
their own family agreements. With the non-profit
organization I founded, Chosen Family Law Center, I advocate for changes in US laws to benefit this whole beautiful spectrum
of family constellations. And it is my core belief
that no matter how you form family, actively discussing
how we intend to live together is the best thing we can do to strengthen
our own personal relationships. 03:40So how did we end up with this current
US emphasis on nuclear family? Most of us throughout history have lived
in large extended family networks and 38 percent of the world
population does today. The nuclear family is actually
a relatively new development. It emerged in the industrial revolution to support a working dad
and a homemaker mom. It peaked in the 1950s and '60s, but it hasn't been the most common
family form before or since. Still, somehow, it's the basis
for our health insurance system. How well is that working out? And a reason for our lack
of affordable childcare in this country. We still build and zone suburban homes
with this fictional family in mind. In Western Europe, where I live,
and in many other countries, states provide support
for citizens in need, including parents who are home
with young children, such as paid maternity leave and financial support throughout
the childhood, if needed. But in US law, we make sure that financial safety net
happens between spouses rather than between citizen and state. US marriage is a social
welfare state of two. I'd rather a different social
welfare state personally. This leaves many people, especially women, stuck in unhealthy relationships. So at this point, we can evaluate how same-sex partnership, when we move into that movement
for same sex marriage, there was really an emphasis on whether we should be
pushing for gay marriage so that gay people could get
the benefits of marriage, or whether we should be working
to protect the rights of the unmarried. And we can do both. It's time now to protect
the rights of unmarried people and other kinds of family constellations. 05:32(Applause) 05:36Because the reality is,
there's no evidence that the nuclear family model
is actually the best one. Research has consistently shown that children need stability
of parental figures. But from what I've consistently found, it doesn't matter
if that stability is mom and dad, two dads, mom and grandma or three polyamorous partners. So this is not only about justice. This is about what's best for children. If we really want that stability for kids, we need to provide support for all
the kinds of families that kids are in, rather than try and fail to push people into a nuclear family model
with government benefits. It's time to observe
what's not working and change course. 06:19My definition of family is people who are committed
to be there for each other, no matter what. This includes chosen family regardless of biological relationship
or legal marriage. Many Black families in the US
have chosen aunties and uncles with no blood relation, but a decision to be family
and a commitment to the children involved. Countless LGBTQ people
create chosen family when they're rejected
by their family of origin or when wanting to create
families that share their values. I am one of those queer people
to find home with chosen family. I grew up in a Christian family
in a small town, the only child of wonderful older parents. When I came out as bisexual, then as polyamorous,
then as gender non-binary, most of my blood relations
and over 30 cousins stopped talking to me. That's pretty standard. When I was a broke 20-something
starting my law practice, I was diagnosed with cervical cancer. And realized that I'd been duped
into buying a health insurance that didn't cover cancer. I was in a desperate,
life-threatening situation. And while my parents were loving, they couldn't provide me
with material support or problem-solving. So I broke through my shame
and my embarrassment about asking for help. And I reached out
to my communities of friends. And I discovered that they were eager
to more actively support one another. They made a schedule, so there was always
someone there to cook, to clean, to make phone calls
about my health coverage or just sit with me while I cried
in my grief and my fear. When I won my appeal to receive coverage
by the Cancer Services Medicaid program, the administrator called and said, ""I don't know who you are,
but a lot of people love you."" 08:12(Applause) 08:19And then she said, ""And I'd like them
to stop calling my office now, please. Let them know you got coverage, it's done. Thank you."" 08:26(Laughter) 08:28The chosen family who stepped up for me probably saved my life. But they wouldn't necessarily be able
to visit me in the hospital or cross a border
in a pandemic to be with me. Because relationships beyond blood
and beyond marriage often don't get those rights. And since then, my life's work
has been to change that and I will. 08:46(Applause and cheers) 08:51When we embrace the idea of chosen family, our own free will is more important
than biological connection. We can choose to create
family relationships with the people who provide us
with the meaningful support that we need and deserve. 09:07Same-sex parenting has also advanced
the concept of family beyond biology, because in a same sex couple, only one parent's providing
the sperm or the egg. In my family-building legal work
with these families, I facilitate discussions to make sure
that everyone's intentions are aligned before designing that legal agreement. For example, I’ll often work with a female
same-sex couple who has a male friend
who wants to ""help"" them become parents. So I'll facilitate discussions
to make sure they're all clear on whether he's going to be
a co-parent or a sperm donor and design a legal agreement either way. Without that, I've seen
too many situations of ambiguity. Where mom calls him a dad
when she needs childcare help but a donor when it comes time
to make a big decision she doesn't want his input on. He calls himself dad
when the baby's adorable at the park, but feels more like a donor
when the school bill comes, you know? When we're designing our own families, we need clear written agreements, especially if children are involved. 10:07Let's say I have two clients,
Sharon and Bill, best friends who are considering
becoming co-parents. Sharon's turned 40 and hasn't found the right man
with whom to marry and have kids. Neither has her gay bestie Bill, who can’t afford the $100,000
surrogacy process by himself. So they call each other their Plan B. I would facilitate discussions with them
about their parenting values, their plans to share
finances for the child, their ideal week of childcare split. But the conversation
often gets more difficult when I ask questions like, ""Are you willing to live in the same city
for the next 18 years to each be near the child?"" We're used to the idea
of sacrificing for a spouse and saying ""no"" to a dream job
in a different city to stay close to each other. But it's a shocking idea
to do that for your buddy. But by becoming co-parenting partners, they need to elevate their level
of commitment from friends to platonic partners. They need to consciously say “goodbye”
to a Prince Charming fantasy and welcome and embrace a new reality of a beautiful partnership
grounded in their long-term friendship and agree that this co-parenting
relationship will come first. I have found in my work that these kinds of discussions
are much more powerful for preventing future disputes
than any written contract can be. We need to have these conversations. Legal contracts are sometimes written
to avoid looking eye to eye and coming to agreement. But family contracts should only
be written after you've done that. 11:40When I design relationships for polyamorous triads of three
or quads of four, I sometimes use existing legal structures like trusts or LLCs, that allow you to share
property and finances without a question
as to your relationship. So, for example, if I've got
a polyamorous triad Ayesha, Susan and Linda, I can set up an LLC for them so that they can co-own
real estate properties, pay taxes together, purchase a common health insurance and have clear
exit strategies if they wish. 12:10(Applause) 12:15And if people trust each other enough to pool their financial fortune
and want to pay taxes together, it shouldn't matter
whether they're business partners, siblings or romantic partners. All of those families are valid. 12:27(Applause) 12:28Thank you. 12:30We should be able to choose legal partners beyond a single romantic
partner, like a spouse. Some people are doing that now, and it's the trend for the future. Domestic partnerships have been used
for 30 years by same-sex couples, but also by best friends and siblings. Doing so, as domestic partners,
allows you to share your health insurance to visit each other in the hospital and across borders
in a pandemic, like spouses. But unlike spouses, you don't become
a social welfare state of two, which can be a good thing. I had a client who had
a severely disabled sister. By becoming domestic partners, she was able to put her sister on her excellent
health insurance coverage. Why would a sister be any less worthy
of that than a boyfriend? Right? Thank you. 13:23(Applause) 13:24We've built on that history. In 2020, my organization
helped pass the first laws for multi-partner domestic partnership, which have passed
in several cities and counting. This means that three
or four polyamorous partners could become domestic partners or two or more platonic co-parents or any two, three or four people who want to become
each other's legal partners. When relationships
have legal status like this, it reduces discrimination and promotes
social acceptance and awareness, as we saw in the same-sex
partnership movement. Still, we hope this year to pass the first family status
nondiscrimination laws at city levels across the United States, which means that you
can't be discriminated against, you can't be fired from your job
or denied housing because of your family configuration. 14:11(Applause) 14:15In future, I propose that we move from these
city-level domestic partnerships to state-level multi-partner
domestic partnerships and then federal recognition, as we did with same-sex marriage. And if we really want
to value families as they exist rather than incentivize marriage, I also suggest that we separate out
some of the legal perks of marriage so that single people and other kinds
of families get these benefits without an evaluation of whether
they're in a romantic relationship that passes muster. 14:46And marriage should not be the gateway
to social and economic privilege anymore. That time is done. And marriages will be stronger
when we do that. Do you know anyone who got married
faster than they should have for health insurance or citizenship? Because I know too many,
and I’m a divorce lawyer. 15:04(Laughter) 15:06As a divorce lawyer,
relationships last longer when we marry for better reasons
than government perks. So, many of you may be married and may not think that these issues
have personal relevance for you. But I ask you to reflect. Could your relationship be stronger if you adopted a more
expansive view of family? Marriage and partnership
are not one-size-fits-all. Every couple in partnership benefits from actively deciding how they want
to co-create together in terms of co-parenting, shared finances, your household and your definition of monogamy. For example, is there any hidden expectation
that you have with your partner that would benefit from being
spoken out loud and confirmed? I bet there is. Or is there any aspect of partnership
that you participate in just because everyone does it, like sleeping in the same bed
or only vacationing together, that just isn't really working
for your partnership? When we expect any one relationship
in our lives to meet most of our needs, we may be putting too much pressure
on that relationship. And whether it's your romantic partner,
your parent, your adult child, your relationship may be stronger if you also strengthen
other connections in your lives and find other ways to get
some of your own needs met. 16:27(Applause) 16:32My husband does not want
to help me process. I have other people for that in my life. So ... I think it's worthwhile to question, no matter what kind of family
configuration you're in, whether you could be part of a movement
for greater interconnectedness beyond our romantic relationships
and beyond the walls of our home. Your family and your community
will be stronger when you do. 16:58Is there a long-term friend
that you could reach out to with whom you'd like to be better in touch and suggest a regular date
for a special time together? Could you create a childcare cooperative
with other parents in your community? Is there a single parent
or elderly person in your life whose home you could spend more time in? 17:23At some point in a long life, you too will need support. And it benefits you
to practice asking for support now and actively caring
for people in community who may one day care for you. A baby whose diaper you change
may one day change yours. 17:40(Audience murmurs and laughs) 17:42Sorry. It's the beautiful reciprocity
of human relationship. And in my vision for the future, while we work together
to redefine family in law, we can all redefine family
in our own culture and lives. There may even be a close friend
to whom you get the courage to ask: Do you want to make family with me? 18:04Thank you. (Applause)"

I'd like to introduce you to someone. This is Jomny. That's ""Jonny"" but spelled
accidentally with an ""m,"" in case you were wondering, because we're not all perfect. 00:13footnotefootnoteJomny is an alien who has been sent to earth
with a mission to study humans. Jomny is feeling lost and alone
and far from home, and I think we've all felt this way. Or, at least I have. I wrote this story about this alien
at a moment in my life when I was feeling particularly alien. I had just moved to Cambridge
and started my doctoral program at MIT, and I was feeling intimidated and isolated
and very much like I didn't belong. 00:41But I had a lifeline of sorts. See, I was writing jokes
for years and years and sharing them on social media, and I found that I was turning
to doing this more and more. 00:54footnotefootnoteNow, for many people,
the internet can feel like a lonely place. It can feel like this, a big, endless, expansive void where you can constantly call out to it
but no one's ever listening. But I actually found a comfort
in speaking out to the void. I found, in sharing
my feelings with the void, eventually the void started to speak back. And it turns out that the void
isn't this endless lonely expanse at all, but instead it's full of
all sorts of other people, also staring out into it
and also wanting to be heard. Now, there have been many bad things
that have come from social media. I'm not trying to dispute that at all. To be online at any given point
is to feel so much sadness and anger and violence. It can feel like the end of the world. Yet, at the same time, I'm conflicted because I can't deny the fact
that so many of my closest friends are people that I had met
originally online. And I think that's partly because
there's this confessional nature to social media. It can feel like you are writing
in this personal, intimate diary that's completely private, yet at the same time you want
everyone in the world to read it. And I think part of that, the joy of that is that we get to experience things
from perspectives from people who are completely
different from ourselves, and sometimes that's a nice thing. 02:12footnotefootnoteFor example, when I first joined Twitter, I found that so many of the people
that I was following were talking about mental health
and going to therapy in ways that had none of the stigma
that they often do when we talk about these issues in person. Through them, the conversation
around mental health was normalized, and they helped me realize
that going to therapy was something that would help me as well. 02:34Now, for many people, it sounds like a scary idea
to be talking about all these topics so publicly and so openly on the internet. I feel like a lot of people
think that it is a big, scary thing to be online if you're not
already perfectly and fully formed. But I think the internet can be
actually a great place to not know, and I think we can
treat that with excitement, because to me there's something
important about sharing your imperfections and your insecurities
and your vulnerabilities with other people. 03:10(Laughter) 03:11footnotefootnoteNow, when someone shares
that they feel sad or afraid or alone, for example, it actually makes me feel less alone, not by getting rid of any of my loneliness but by showing me that I am not alone in feeling lonely. And as a writer and as an artist, I care very much about making
this comfort of being vulnerable a communal thing, something that we
can share with each other. I'm excited about
externalizing the internal, about taking those invisible personal
feelings that I don't have words for, holding them to the light,
putting words to them, and then sharing them with other people in the hopes that it might help them
find words to find their feelings as well. 03:50footnotefootnoteNow, I know that sounds like a big thing, but ultimately I'm interested
in putting all these things into small, approachable packages, because when we can hide them
into these smaller pieces, I think they are easier to approach,
I think they're more fun. I think they can more easily help us
see our shared humanness. Sometimes that takes the form
of a short story, sometimes that takes the form of
a cute book of illustrations, for example. And sometimes that takes the form of a silly joke
that I'll throw on the internet. For example, a few months ago,
I posted this app idea for a dog-walking service where a dog shows up at your door
and you have to get out of the house and go for a walk. 04:27(Laughter) 04:30If there are app developers
in the audience, please find me after the talk. 04:34Or, I like to share every time
I feel anxious about sending an email. When I sign my emails ""Best,"" it's short for ""I am trying my best,"" which is short for ""Please don't hate me,
I promise I'm trying my best!"" 04:46Or my answer to the classic icebreaker, if I could have dinner with anyone,
dead or alive, I would. I am very lonely. 04:53(Laughter) 04:57And I find that when
I post things like these online, the reaction is very similar. People come together to share a laugh, to share in that feeling, and then to disburse just as quickly. 05:08(Laughter) 05:10Yes, leaving me once again alone. But I think sometimes these
little gatherings can be quite meaningful. 05:18footnotefootnoteFor example, when I graduated
from architecture school and I moved to Cambridge, I posted this question: ""How many people in your life
have you already had your last conversation with?"" And I was thinking about
my own friends who had moved away to different cities
and different countries, even, and how hard it would be
for me to keep in touch with them. But other people started replying
and sharing their own experiences. Somebody talked about a family member
they had a falling out with. Someone talked about a loved one
who had passed away quickly and unexpectedly. Someone else talked
about their friends from school who had moved away as well. But then something really nice
started happening. Instead of just replying to me, people started replying to each other, and they started to talk to each other
and share their own experiences and comfort each other and encourage each other
to reach out to that friend that they hadn't spoken to in a while or that family member
that they had a falling out with. And eventually, we got
this little tiny microcommunity. It felt like this support group formed of all sorts of people coming together. And I think every time we post online, every time we do this, there's a chance that these little
microcommunities can form. There's a chance that all sorts
of different creatures can come together and be drawn together. And sometimes, through
the muck of the internet, you get to find a kindred spirit. Sometimes that's
in the reading the replies and the comments sections and finding
a reply that is particularly kind or insightful or funny. Sometimes that's
in going to follow someone and seeing that they
already follow you back. And sometimes that's in looking at someone
that you know in real life and seeing the things that you write
and the things that they write and realizing that you share so many
of the same interests as they do, and that brings them
closer together to you. Sometimes, if you're lucky, you get to meet another alien. 07:12[when two aliebns find each other
in a strange place, it feels a litle more like home] 07:17footnotefootnoteBut I am worried, too,
because as we all know, the internet for the most part
doesn't feel like this. We all know that for the most part, the internet feels like a place
where we misunderstand each other, where we come into conflict
with each other, where there's all sorts of confusion
and screaming and yelling and shouting, and it feels like
there's too much of everything. It feels like chaos, and I don't know how to square away
the bad parts with the good, because as we know and as we've seen, the bad parts can really, really hurt us. It feels to me that the platforms
that we use to inhabit these online spaces have been designed
either ignorantly or willfully to allow for harassment and abuse,
to propagate misinformation, to enable hatred and hate speech
and the violence that comes from it, and it feels like
none of our current platforms are doing enough
to address and to fix that. 08:12But still, and maybe
probably unfortunately, I'm still drawn to these online spaces,
as many others are, because sometimes it just feels
like that's where all the people are. And I feel silly and stupid sometimes for valuing these small moments
of human connection in times like these. But I've always operated under this idea that these little moments of humanness
are not superfluous. They're not retreats
from the world at all, but instead they're the reasons
why we come to these spaces. They are important and vital
and they affirm and they give us life. And they are these tiny,
temporary sanctuaries that show us that we are not
as alone as we think we are. And so yes, even though life is bad
and everyone's sad and one day we're all going to die -- 09:03[look. life is bad. everyones sad. We're all gona die, but i alredy bought
this inflatable bouncey castle so are u gona take Ur shoes off or not] 09:10footnotefootnoteI think the inflatable metaphorical
bouncy castle in this case is really our relationships
and our connections to other people. 09:22footnotefootnoteAnd so one night, when I was feeling particularly sad
and hopeless about the world, I shouted out to the void, to the lonely darkness. I said, ""At this point,
logging on to social media feels like holding someone's hand
at the end of the world."" And this time, instead of
the void responding, it was people who showed up, who started replying to me and then
who started talking to each other, and slowly this little
tiny community formed. Everybody came together to hold hands. 09:51And in these dangerous and unsure times, in the midst of it all, I think the thing that we have
to hold on to is other people. And I know that is a small thing
made up of small moments, but I think it is one tiny,
tiny sliver of light in all the darkness. 10:12Thank you. 10:13(Applause) 10:18Thank you. 10:19(Applause)"
