# Conclusion      

From the sentiment analysis, we could clearly see that TED talks always posts positive speaks, which can inspire audiences to face challenges and consider the issues from a positive side. On the other hand, we can observe that this situation does not distinguish between the categories of videos, so to some extent there is the lack of diversity in term of the videos' sentiment.  
  
# Further study and Limitation    

One of the limitations of the data used in our analysis is the difficulty of obtaining a large amount of transcript data due to limitations in time and computer capacity. Additionally, the structure of the TED website is not conducive to scraping text, which hinders the richness and diversity of the data. Furthermore, the distribution of additional features on the TED website, such as information about the speakers and viewer comments, is fragmented, limiting the value of these features in our analysis.

In addition, we can expand our research based on the available information. For example, we can analyze trends in TED talk releases and predict their release schedule, which can help investors understand TED's plans and the messages it intends to deliver to its audience. We can also analyze the variations in the wording of speeches given by the same speakers or on the same topics. Additionally, TED currently has nearly 400 options for categorizing videos, which may not be ideal for users trying to find a specific topic. Therefore, TED can improve the classification of videos by analyzing which categories viewers are more inclined to comment on in their feedback.
